Renyi entropy of the critical O(N) model
Anirbit Mukherjee 
In this article we explore a certain definition of "alternate quantization"
for the critical O(N) model. We elaborate on a prescription to evaluate the
Renyi entropy of alternately quantized critical O(N) model. We show that there
exists new saddles of the q-Renyi free energy functional corresponding to
putting certain combinations of the Kaluza-Klein modes into alternate
quantization. This leads us to an analysis of trying to determine the true
state of the theory by trying to ascertain the global minima among these saddle
points.

An almost sure KPZ relation for SLE and Brownian motion
Ewain Gwynne Nina Holden Jason Miller 
The peanosphere construction of Duplantier, Miller, and Sheffield provides a
means of representing a $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface,
$\gamma \in (0,2)$, decorated with a space-filling form of Schramm's
SLE$_\kappa$, $\kappa = 16/\gamma^2 \in (4,\infty)$, $\eta$ as a gluing of a
pair of trees which are encoded by a correlated two-dimensional Brownian motion
$Z$. We prove a KPZ-type formula which relates the Hausdorff dimension of any
Borel subset $A$ of the range of $\eta$ which can be defined as a function of
$\eta$ (modulo time parameterization) to the Hausdorff dimension of the
corresponding time set $\eta^{-1}(A)$. This result serves to reduce the problem
of computing the Hausdorff dimension of any set associated with an SLE, CLE, or
related processes in the interior of a domain to the problem of computing the
Hausdorff dimension of a certain set associated with a Brownian motion. For
many natural examples, the associated Brownian motion set is well-known. As
corollaries, we obtain new proofs of the Hausdorff dimensions of the
SLE$_\kappa$ curve for $\kappa \not=4$; the double points and cut points of
SLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa >4$; and the intersection of two flow lines of a
Gaussian free field. We also obtain the Hausdorff dimension of the set of
$m$-tuple points of space-filling SLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa>4$ and $m \geq 3$ by
computing the Hausdorff dimension of the so-called $(m-2)$-tuple $\pi/2$-cone
times of a correlated planar Brownian motion.

Universal bounds on current fluctuations
Patrick Pietzonka Andre C. Barato Udo Seifert 
For current fluctuations in non-equilibrium steady states of Markovian
processes, we derive four different universal bounds valid beyond the Gaussian
regime. Different variants of these bounds apply to either the entropy change
or any individual current, e.g., the rate of substrate consumption in a
chemical reaction or the electron current in an electronic device. The bounds
vary with respect to their degree of universality and tightness. A universal
parabolic bound on the generating function of an arbitrary current depends
solely on the average entropy production. A second, stronger bound requires
knowledge both of the thermodynamic forces that drive the system and of the
topology of the network of states. These two bounds are conjectures based on
extensive numerics. An exponential bound that depends only on the average
entropy production and the average number of transitions per time is rigorously
proved. This bound has no obvious relation to the parabolic bound but it is
typically tighter further away from equilibrium. An asymptotic bound that
depends on the specific transition rates and becomes tight for large
fluctuations is also derived. This bound allows for the prediction of the
asymptotic growth of the generating function. Even though our results are
restricted to networks with a finite number of states, we show that the
parabolic bound is also valid for three paradigmatic examples of driven
diffusive systems for which the generating function can be calculated using the
additivity principle. Our bounds provide a new general class of constraints for
nonequilibrium systems.

Approximation of high quantiles from intermediate quantiles
Cees de Valk 
Motivated by applications requiring quantile estimates for very small
probabilities of exceedance, this article addresses estimation of high
quantiles for probabilities bounded by powers of sample size with exponents
below -1. As regularity assumption, an alternative to the Generalised Pareto
tail limit is explored for this purpose. Motivation for the alternative
regularity assumption is provided, and it is shown to be equivalent to a limit
relation for the logarithm of survival function, the log-GW tail limit, which
generalises the GW (Generalised Weibull) tail limit, a generalisation of the
Weibull tail limit. The domain of attraction is described, and convergence
results are presented for quantile approximation and for a simple quantile
estimator based on the log-GW tail. Simulations are presented, and advantages
and limitations of log-GW-based estimation of high quantiles are indicated.

Origin of the Proton-to-Helium Ratio Anomaly in Cosmic Rays
Nicola Tomassetti 
Recent data on Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) revealed that the helium energy
spectrum is harder than the proton spectrum. The AMS experiment has now
reported that the proton-to-helium ratio as function of rigidity $R$
(momentum-to-charge ratio) falls off steadily as p/He $\sim R^\Delta$, with
$\Delta\approx$-0.08 between $R\sim$40 GV and $R\sim$2 TV. Besides, the single
spectra of proton and helium are found to progressively harden at $R\gtrsim$100
GV. The p/He anomaly is generally ascribed to particle-dependent acceleration
mechanisms occurring in Galactic CR sources. However, this explanation poses a
challenge to the known mechanisms of particle acceleration since they are
believed to be "universal", composition blind, rigidity mechanisms. Using the
new AMS data, we show that the p/He anomaly can be simply explained in terms of
a two-component scenario where the GeV-TeV flux is ascribed to a hydrogen-rich
source, possibly a nearby supernova remnant, characterized by a soft
acceleration spectrum. This simple idea provides a common interpretation for
the p/He ratio and for the single spectra of proton and helium: both anomalies
are explained by a flux transition between two components. The "universality"
of particle acceleration in sources is not violated in this model. A
distinctive signature of our scenario is the high-energy flattening of the p/He
ratio at multi-TeV energies, which is hinted at by existing data and will be
resolutely tested by new space experiments ISS-CREAM and CALET.

An attractor neural network architecture with an ultra high information
  capacity: numerical results
Alireza Alemi 
Attractor neural network is an important theoretical scenario for modeling
memory function in the hippocampus and in the cortex. In these models, memories
are stored in the plastic recurrent connections of neural populations in the
form of "attractor states". The maximal information capacity for conventional
abstract attractor networks with unconstrained connections is 2 bits/synapse.
However, an unconstrained synapse has the capacity to store infinite amount of
bits in a noiseless theoretical scenario: a capacity that conventional
attractor networks cannot achieve. Here, I propose a hierarchical attractor
network that can achieve an ultra high information capacity. The network has
two layers: a visible layer with $N_v$ neurons, and a hidden layer with $N_h$
neurons. The visible-to-hidden connections are set at random and kept fixed
during the training phase, in which the memory patterns are stored as
fixed-points of the network dynamics. The hidden-to-visible connections,
initially normally distributed, are learned via a local, online learning rule
called the Three-Threshold Learning Rule and there is no within-layer
connections. The results of simulations suggested that the maximal information
capacity grows exponentially with the expansion ratio $N_h/N_v$. As a first
order approximation to understand the mechanism providing the high capacity, I
simulated a naive mean-field approximation (nMFA) of the network. The
exponential increase was captured by the nMFA, revealing that a key underlying
factor is the correlation between the hidden and the visible units.
Additionally, it was observed that, at maximal capacity, the degree of symmetry
of the connectivity between the hidden and the visible neurons increases with
the expansion ratio. These results highlight the role of hierarchical
architecture in remarkably increasing the performance of information storage in
attractor networks.

Nearly optimal separations between communication (or query) complexity
  and partitions
Robin Kothari 
We show a nearly quadratic separation between deterministic communication
complexity and the logarithm of the partition number, which is essentially
optimal. This improves upon a recent power 1.5 separation of G\"o\"os, Pitassi,
and Watson (FOCS 2015). In query complexity, we establish a nearly quadratic
separation between deterministic (and even randomized) query complexity and
subcube partition complexity, which is also essentially optimal. We also
establish a nearly power 1.5 separation between quantum query complexity and
subcube partition complexity, the first superlinear separation between the two
measures. Lastly, we show a quadratic separation between quantum query
complexity and one-sided subcube partition complexity.
  Our query complexity separations use the recent cheat sheet framework of
Aaronson, Ben-David, and the author. Our query functions are built up in stages
by alternating function composition with the cheat sheet construction. The
communication complexity separation follows from lifting the query separation
to communication complexity.

The onset of layer undulations in smectic A liquid crystals due to a
  strong magnetic field
A. Contreras C. García-Azpeitia C. J. García-Cervera S. Joo 
We investigate the effect of a strong magnetic field on a three dimensional
smectic A liquid crystal. We identify a critical field above which the uniform
layered state loses stability; this is associated to the onset of layer
undulations. In a previous work, Garc\'ia-Cervera and Joo considered the two
dimensional case and analyzed the transition to the undulated state via a
simple bifurcation. In dimension n=3 the situation is more delicate because the
first eigenvalue of the corresponding linearized problem is not simple. We
overcome the difficulties inherent to this higher dimensional setting by
identifying the irreducible representations for natural actions on the
functional that take into account the invariances of the problem thus allowing
for reducing the bifurcation analysis to a subspace with symmetries. We are
able to describe at least two bifurcation branches, one of which is stable,
highlighting the richer landscape of energy critical states in the three
dimensional setting. Finally, we analyze a reduced two dimensional problem,
assuming the magnetic field is very strong, and are able to relate this to a
model in micromagnetics studied, from where we deduce the periodicity property
of minimizers.

Reconstructing the direction of reactor antineutrinos via electron
  scattering in Gd-doped water Cherenkov detectors
D. Hellfeld S. Dazeley A. Bernstein C. Marianno 
The potential of elastic antineutrino-electron scattering ($\bar{\nu_e} +
e^-$$\rightarrow \bar{\nu_e} + e^-$) in a Gd-doped water Cherenkov detector to
determine the direction of a nuclear reactor antineutrino flux was investigated
using the recently proposed WATCHMAN antineutrino experiment as a baseline
model. The expected scattering rate was determined assuming a 13 km standoff
from a 3.758 GWt light water nuclear reactor. Background was estimated via
independent simulations and by appropriately scaling published measurements
from similar detectors. Many potential backgrounds were considered, including
solar neutrinos, misidentified reactor-based inverse beta decay interactions,
cosmogenic radionuclide and water-borne radon decays, and gamma rays from the
photomultiplier tubes, detector walls, and surrounding rock. The detector
response was modeled using a GEANT4-based simulation package. The results
indicate that with the use of low radioactivity PMTs and sufficient
fiducialization, water-borne radon and cosmogenic radionuclides pose the
largest threats to sensitivity. The directional sensitivity was then analyzed
as a function of radon contamination, detector depth, and detector size. The
results provide a list of theoretical conditions that, if satisfied in
practice, would enable nuclear reactor antineutrino directionality in a
Gd-doped water Cherenkov detector approximately 10 km from a large power
reactor.

Quantum Hořava-Lifshitz cosmology and the quantum nature of coupling

In this work were studied quantum models of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
(FRW) cosmology in the framework of the gravity's theory proposed by
Ho\v{r}ava, the so-called Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory of the gravity. It was
used the Ho\v{r}ava theory for the projectable Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity
without the detailed balance condition. Following the quantization of the model
in the context of Wheeler-DeWitt approach and taking in account the ordering
factor for operators were found the cosmological wave function. Solutions were
studied and the results were discussed for some particular cases close of
initial singularity. The resulting wave functions were used to investigate the
possibility of to avoid the classical singularities due to quantum effects and
for analyzing the entanglement entropy. In the ultraviolet phase were found the
existence of cosmological wave function with a relation between the ordering
factor and coupling constants showing their quantum nature, then it was
possible to provide an explicit evolution of the cosmological entanglement
entropy in this stage. The interpretation of Bohm-De Broglie was used to
discussion of the solutions.

Many-body effects on Cr(001) surfaces: An LDA+DMFT study
M. Schüler S. Barthel M. Karolak A. I. Poteryaev A. I. Lichtenstein M. I. Katsnelson G. Sangiovanni T. O. Wehling 
The electronic structure of the Cr(001) surface with its sharp resonance at
the Fermi level is the topic of many experimental and theoretical works. It is
to date unclear and controversially debated whether the origin of this
resonance is an orbital Kondo or an electron-phonon coupling effect. We have
combined ab-initio density functional calculations with dynamical mean-field
simulations to calculate the orbitally resolved spectral function of the
Cr(001) surface. The calculated orbital character and shape of the spectrum is
in agreement with data from (inverse) photo emission experiments. We find
pronounced electron-electron correlation to be the key for the surface
electronic structure. Our findings help to reconvene controversial experimental
results from (I)PES and STM measurements. We conclude that the combination of
the realistic description of the electronic structure and the dynamic treatment
of local correlation is necessary to describe the complex many-body effect in
$d_{z^2}$ and $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals, which forms the low-energy resonance.

The Human Kernel
Andrew Gordon Wilson Christoph Dann Christopher G. Lucas Eric P. Xing 
Bayesian nonparametric models, such as Gaussian processes, provide a
compelling framework for automatic statistical modelling: these models have a
high degree of flexibility, and automatically calibrated complexity. However,
automating human expertise remains elusive; for example, Gaussian processes
with standard kernels struggle on function extrapolation problems that are
trivial for human learners. In this paper, we create function extrapolation
problems and acquire human responses, and then design a kernel learning
framework to reverse engineer the inductive biases of human learners across a
set of behavioral experiments. We use the learned kernels to gain psychological
insights and to extrapolate in human-like ways that go beyond traditional
stationary and polynomial kernels. Finally, we investigate Occam's razor in
human and Gaussian process based function learning.

Emergent space-time and the supersymmetric index
Nathan Benjamin Shamit Kachru Christoph A. Keller Natalie M. Paquette 
It is of interest to find criteria on a 2d CFT which indicate that it gives
rise to emergent gravity in a macroscopic 3d AdS space via holography.
Symmetric orbifolds in the large $N$ limit have partition functions which are
consistent with an emergent space-time string theory with $L_{\rm string} \sim
L_{\rm AdS}$. For supersymmetric CFTs, the elliptic genus can serve as a
sensitive probe of whether the SCFT admits a large radius gravity description
with $L_{\rm string} \ll L_{\rm AdS}$ after one deforms away from the symmetric
orbifold point in moduli space. We discuss several classes of constructions
whose elliptic genera strongly hint that gravity with $L_{\rm Planck} \ll
L_{\rm string} \ll L_{\rm AdS}$ can emerge at suitable points in moduli space.

Open EFTs, IR Effects and Late-Time Resummations: Systematic Corrections
  in Stochastic Inflation
C. P. Burgess R. Holman G. Tasinato 
Though simple inflationary models describe the CMB well, their corrections
are often plagued by infrared effects that obstruct a reliable calculation of
late-time behaviour. We adapt to cosmology tools designed to address similar
issues in other physical systems with the goal of making reliable late-time
inflationary predictions. The main such tool is Open EFTs which reduce in the
inflationary case to Stochastic Inflation plus calculable corrections. We apply
this to a simple inflationary model that is complicated enough to have
dangerous IR behaviour yet simple enough to allow the inference of late-time
behaviour. We find corrections to standard Stochastic Inflationary predictions
for the noise and drift, and we find these corrections ensure the IR finiteness
of both these quantities. The late-time probability distribution, ${\cal
P}(\phi)$, for super-Hubble field fluctuations are obtained as functions of the
noise and drift and so these too are IR finite. We compare our results to other
methods (such as large-$N$ models) and find they agree when these models are
reliable. In all cases we can explore in detail we find IR secular effects
describe the slow accumulation of small perturbations to give a big effect: a
significant distortion of the late-time probability distribution for the field.
But the energy density associated with this is only of order $H^4$ at late
times and so does {\em not} generate a dramatic gravitational back-reaction.

symmetry current multiplets and of ${\mathcal N}=2$ chiral operators. For both
correlation functions we review the solution of the superconformal Ward
identities and describe their superconformal block decompositions. This
provides the foundation for an extensive numerical analysis discussed in the
second half of the paper. We find a large number of constraints for operator
dimensions, OPE coefficients, and central charges that must hold for any
${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal field theory.

Bayesian Uncertainty Management in Temporal Dependence of Extremes
Thomas Lugrin Anthony C. Davison Jonathan A. Tawn 
Both marginal and dependence features must be described when modelling the
extremes of a stationary time series. There are standard approaches to marginal
modelling, but long- and short-range dependence of extremes may both appear. An
assumption of long-range independence often seems reasonable, but short-range
dependence, i.e., the clustering of extremes, needs attention. The extremal
index $0<\theta\le 1$ is a natural limiting measure of clustering, but for wide
classes of dependent processes, including all Gaussian processes, it cannot
distinguish dependent processes from independent processes with $\theta=1$.
Eastoe and Tawn (2012) exploit methods from multivariate extremes to treat the
subasymptotic extremal dependence structure of stationary time series, covering
both $0<\theta<1$ and $\theta=1$, through the introduction of a threshold-based
extremal index. Inference for their dependence models uses an inefficient
stepwise procedure that has various weaknesses and has no reliable assessment
of uncertainty. We overcome these issues using a Bayesian semiparametric
approach. Simulations and the analysis of a UK daily river flow time series
show that the new approach provides improved efficiency for estimating
properties of functionals of clusters.

Axial form factors of the octet baryons in a covariant quark model
G. Ramalho K. Tsushima 
We study the weak interaction axial form factors of the octet baryons, within
the covariant spectator quark model, focusing on the dependence of
four-momentum transfer squared, Q^2. In our model the axial form factors
G_A(Q^2) (axial-vector form factor) and G_P(Q^2) (induced pseudoscalar form
factor), are calculated based on the constituent quark axial form factors and
the octet baryon wave functions. The quark axial current is parametrized by the
two constituent quark form factors, the axial-vector form factor g_A^q(Q^2),
and the induced pseudoscalar form factor g_P^q(Q^2). The baryon wave functions
are composed of a dominant S-state and a P-state mixture for the relative
angular momentum of the quarks. First, we study in detail the nucleon case. We
assume that the quark axial-vector form factor g_A^q(Q^2) has the same function
form as that of the quark electromagnetic isovector form factor. The remaining
parameters of the model, the P-state mixture and the Q^2-dependence of
g_P^q(Q^2), are determined by a fit to the nucleon axial form factor data
obtained by lattice QCD simulations with large pion masses. In this lattice QCD
regime the meson cloud effects are small, and the physics associated with the
valence quarks can be better calibrated. Once the valence quark model is
calibrated, we extend the model to the physical regime, and use the low Q^2
experimental data to estimate the meson cloud contributions for G_A(Q^2) and
G_P(Q^2). Using the calibrated quark axial form factors, and the generalization
of the nucleon wave function for the other octet baryon members, we make
predictions for all the possible weak interaction axial form factors G_A(Q^2)
and G_P(Q^2) of the octet baryons. The results are compared with the
corresponding experimental data for G_A(0), and with the estimates of
baryon-meson models based on SU(6) symmetry.

Towards Principled Unsupervised Learning
Ilya Sutskever Rafal Jozefowicz Karol Gregor Danilo Rezende Tim Lillicrap Oriol Vinyals 
General unsupervised learning is a long-standing conceptual problem in
machine learning. Supervised learning is successful because it can be solved by
the minimization of the training error cost function. Unsupervised learning is
not as successful, because the unsupervised objective may be unrelated to the
supervised task of interest. For an example, density modelling and
reconstruction have often been used for unsupervised learning, but they did not
produced the sought-after performance gains, because they have no knowledge of
the supervised tasks.
  In this paper, we present an unsupervised cost function which we name the
Output Distribution Matching (ODM) cost, which measures a divergence between
the distribution of predictions and distributions of labels. The ODM cost is
appealing because it is consistent with the supervised cost in the following
sense: a perfect supervised classifier is also perfect according to the ODM
cost. Therefore, by aggressively optimizing the ODM cost, we are almost
guaranteed to improve our supervised performance whenever the space of possible
predictions is exponentially large.
  We demonstrate that the ODM cost works well on number of small and
semi-artificial datasets using no (or almost no) labelled training cases.
Finally, we show that the ODM cost can be used for one-shot domain adaptation,
which allows the model to classify inputs that differ from the input
distribution in significant ways without the need for prior exposure to the new
domain.

Environments, available on request), assuming spherical symmetry and power-law
ambient density profiles and using the Pi-theorem. This allows us to test a
wide variety of configurations, their functional dependencies, and to find
classes of solutions for given observations.
  Here, we study Type Ia (SN~Ia) surroundings of single and double degenerate
systems, and their observational signatures. Winds may originate from the
progenitor prior to the white dwarf (WD) stage, the WD, a donor star, or an
accretion disk (AD). For M_Ch explosions,the AD wind dominates and produces a
low-density void several light years across surrounded by a dense shell. The
bubble explains the lack of observed interaction in late time SN light curves
for, at least, several years. The shell produces narrow ISM lines Doppler
shifted by 10-100 km/s, and equivalent widths of approximately 100 mA and 1 mA
in case of ambient environments with constant density and produced by prior
mass loss, respectively. For SN 2014J, both mergers and M_Ch mass explosions
have been suggested based on radio and narrow lines.
  As a consistent and most likely solution, we find an AD wind running into an
environment produced by the RG wind of the progenitor during the pre-WD stage,
and a short delay, 0.013 to 1.4 Myr, between the WD formation and the
explosion. Our framework may be applied more generally to stellar winds and
star-formation feedback in large scale galactic evolution simulations.

We consider the Lieb-Thirring inequalities on the d-dimensional torus with

Manifold Regularized Discriminative Neural Networks
Shuangfei Zhai Zhongfei Zhang 
Unregularized deep neural networks (DNNs) can be easily overfit with a
limited sample size. We argue that this is mostly due to the disriminative
nature of DNNs which directly model the conditional probability (or score) of
labels given the input. The ignorance of input distribution makes DNNs
difficult to generalize to unseen data. Recent advances in regularization
techniques, such as pretraining and dropout, indicate that modeling input data
distribution (either explicitly or implicitly) greatly improves the
generalization ability of a DNN. In this work, we explore the manifold
hypothesis which assumes that instances within the same class lie in a smooth
manifold. We accordingly propose two simple regularizers to a standard
discriminative DNN. The first one, named Label-Aware Manifold Regularization,
assumes the availability of labels and penalizes large norms of the loss
function w.r.t. data points. The second one, named Label-Independent Manifold
Regularization, does not use label information and instead penalizes the
Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of prediction scores w.r.t. data points,
which makes semi-supervised learning possible. We perform extensive control
experiments on fully supervised and semi-supervised tasks using the MNIST
dataset and set the state-of-the-art results on it.

The Lyman-Continuum Photon Production Efficiency xi_{ion} of z~4-5
  Galaxies from IRAC-based Halpha Measurements: Implications for the Escape
  Fraction and Cosmic Reionization
R. J. Bouwens R. Smit I. Labbe M. Franx J. Caruana P. Oesch M. Stefanon N. Rasappu 
Galaxies represent one of the preferred candidate sources to drive the
reionization of the universe. Even as gains are made in mapping the galaxy UV
luminosity density to z>6, significant uncertainties remain regarding the
conversion to the implied ionizing emissivity. The relevant unknowns are the
Lyman-continuum (LyC) photon production efficiency xi_{ion} and the escape
fraction f_{esc}. As we show here, the first of these unknowns is directly
measureable in z=4-5 galaxies, based on the impact the Halpha line has on the
observed IRAC fluxes. By computing a LyC photon production rate from the
implied Halpha luminosities for a broad selection of z=4-5 galaxies and
comparing this against the dust-corrected UV-continuum luminosities, we provide
the first-ever direct estimates of the LyC photon production efficiency
xi_{ion} for the z>~4 galaxy population. We find log_{10} xi_{ion}/[Hz/ergs] to
have a mean value of 25.28_{-0.09}^{+0.10} and 25.34_{-0.08}^{+0.09} for sub-L*
z=4-5 galaxies adopting Calzetti and SMC dust laws, respectively. Reassuringly,
both values are consistent with standardly assumed xi_{ion}'s in reionization
models, with a slight preference for higher xi_{ion}'s (by ~0.1 dex) adopting
the SMC dust law. A modest ~0.03-dex increase in these estimates would result
if the escape fraction for ionizing photons is non-zero and galaxies dominate
the ionizing emissivity at z~4.4. High values of xi_{ion} (~25.5-25.9 dex) are
derived for the bluest galaxies (beta<-2.3) in our samples, independent of dust
law and consistent with results for a z=7.045 galaxy. Such elevated values of
xi_{ion} would have important consequences, indicating that f_{esc} cannot be
in excess of 13% unless the galaxy UV luminosity function does not extend down
to -13 mag or the clumping factor is greater than 3. A low escape fraction
would fit well with the low rate of LyC leakage observed at z~3.

Fast and Accurate Deep Network Learning by Exponential Linear Units
  (ELUs)
Djork-Arné Clevert Thomas Unterthiner Sepp Hochreiter 
We introduce the "exponential linear unit" (ELU) which speeds up learning in
deep neural networks and leads to higher classification accuracies. Like
rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs
(PReLUs), ELUs also avoid a vanishing gradient via the identity for positive
values. However ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the
units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative
values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero. Zero
means speed up learning because they bring the gradient closer to the unit
natural gradient. We show that the unit natural gradient differs from the
normal gradient by a bias shift term, which is proportional to the mean
activation of incoming units. Like batch normalization, ELUs push the mean
towards zero, but with a significantly smaller computational footprint. While
other activation functions like LReLUs and PReLUs also have negative values,
they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a
negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the propagated
variation and information. Therefore ELUs code the degree of presence of
particular phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively model the
degree of their absence. Consequently dependencies between ELUs are much easier
to model and distinct concepts are less likely to interfere. We found that ELUs
lead not only to faster learning, but also to better generalization performance
once networks have many layers (>4). ELU networks were among top 10 reported
CIFAR-10 results and yielded the best published result on CIFAR-100, without
resorting to multi-view evaluation or model averaging. On ImageNet, ELUs
considerably speed up learning compared to a ReLU network with the same
architecture, obtaining less than 10% classification error for a single crop,
single model network.

Kalman-based Stochastic Gradient Method with Stop Condition and
  Insensitivity to Conditioning
Vivak Patel 
Proximal and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods are believed to
efficiently minimize large composite objective functions, but such methods have
two algorithmic challenges: (1) a lack of fast or justified stopping
conditions, and (2) sensitivity to the problem's conditioning. Second order SGD
methods show promise in solving these problems, but they are (3) marred by the
complexity of their analysis. In this work, we address these three issues on
the limited, but important, linear regression problem by introducing and
analyzing a second order proximal/SGD method based on Kalman Filtering (kSGD).
Through our analysis, we develop a fast algorithm with a justified stopping
condition, prove that kSGD is insensitive to the problem's conditioning, and
develop a unique approach for analyzing the complex second order dynamics. Our
theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments on a large public
use data set from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid. Byproducts of our
analysis include, primarily, a foundation for extending kSGD to other problem
types, parallel implementations with convergence guarantees and low memory
applications, and, secondarily, extensions to Kalman Filtering theory.

Generating Permutations with Restricted Containers
Michael H. Albert Cheyne Homberger Jay Pantone Nathaniel Shar Vincent Vatter 
We investigate a generalization of stacks that we call
$\mathcal{C}$-machines. We show how this viewpoint rapidly leads to functional
equations for the classes of permutations that $\mathcal{C}$-machines generate,
and how these systems of functional equations can frequently be solved by
either the kernel method or, much more easily, by guessing and checking.
General results about the rationality, algebraicity, and the existence of
Wilfian formulas for some classes generated by $\mathcal{C}$-machines are
given. We also draw attention to some relatively small permutation classes
which, although we can generate thousands of terms of their enumerations, seem
to not have D-finite generating functions.

Spatially-coupled Split-component Codes with Iterative Algebraic
  Decoding
Lei M. Zhang Dmitri Truhachev Frank Kschischang 
We analyze a class of high performance, low decoding-data-flow
error-correcting codes suitable for high bit-rate optical-fiber communication
systems. A spatially-coupled split-component ensemble is defined, generalizing
from the most important codes of this class, staircase codes and braided block
codes, and preserving a deterministic partitioning of component-code bits over
code blocks. Our analysis focuses on low-complexity iterative algebraic
decoding, which, for the binary erasure channel, is equivalent to a
generalization of the peeling decoder. Using the differential equation method,
we derive a vector recursion that tracks the expected residual graph evolution
throughout the decoding process. The threshold of the recursion is found using
potential function analysis. We generalize the analysis to mixture ensembles
consisting of more than one type of component code, which provide increased
flexibility of ensemble parameters and can improve performance. The analysis
extends to the binary symmetric channel by assuming mis-correction-free
component-code decoding. Simple upper-bounds on the number of errors
correctable by the ensemble are derived. Finally, we analyze the threshold of
spatially-coupled split-component ensembles under beyond bounded-distance
component decoding.

On the spectral stability of kinks in 2D Klein-Gordon model with
  parity-time-symmetric perturbation
Denis I. Borisov Sergey V. Dmitriev 
In a series of recent works by Demirkaya et al. stability analysis for the
static kink solutions to the 1D continuous and discrete Klein-Gordon equations
with a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric perturbation has been analysed. We consider the
linear stability problem for the static kink in 2D Klein-Gordon field taking
into account spatially localized $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric perturbation. The
perturbation is in the form of viscous friction, which does not affect the
static solutions to the unperturbed Klein-Gordon equation. Small dynamic
perturbation around the static kink solution is considered to formulate the
linear stability problem. The effect of the small perturbation on the solutions
to the corresponding eigenvalue problem is analysed. The main result is
presented in the form of a theorem describing the behavior of the eigenvalues
corresponding to the extended and localised eigenmodes as the functions of the
perturbation parameter.

Time Resolved Single Dopant Charge Dynamics in Silicon
Mohammad Rashidi Jacob Burgess Marco Taucer Roshan Achal Jason L. Pitters Sebastian Loth Robert A. Wolkow 
As the ultimate miniaturization of semiconductor devices approaches, it is
imperative that the effects of single dopants be clarified. Beyond providing
insight into function and limitations of conventional devices, such information
enables identification of new device concepts. Atomically resolved, electronic
pump-probe scanning tunneling microscopy permits unprecedented, quantitative
measurement of time-resolved single dopant ionization dynamics. Tunneling
through the surface dangling bond makes feasible what would otherwise be too
weak a signal to observe. We introduce a time-resolved
scanning-tunneling-spectroscopy method whereby current measurements are made
before the system of study relaxes or adjusts to accommodate an applied field.
Distinct ionization and neutralization rates of a single dopant are measured
and the physical process controlling those are identified.

exp[sigma(y)] in the scenario with one extra coordinate y, non-factorizable

Einstein-Hilbert's equations up to a constant C. It is demonstrated that
different values of C results in theories with quite different spectra of the

function in both the source joint distribution and the distortion level.

Temporal second-order coherence function for displaced-squeezed thermal
  states
Moorad Alexanian 
We calculate the quantum mechanical, temporal second-order coherence function
for a single-mode, degenerate parametric amplifier for a system in the Gaussian
state, viz., a displaced-squeezed thermal state. The calculation involves first
the dynamical generation at time $t$ of the Gaussian state from an initial
thermal state and subsequent measurements of two photons a time $\tau \geq 0$
apart. The generation of the Gaussian state by the parametric amplifier ensures
that the temporal second-order coherence function depends only on $\tau$, via
$\tau/t$, for given Gaussian state parameters, Gaussian state preparation time
$t$, and average number $\bar{n}$ of thermal photons. It is interesting that
the time evolution for displaced thermal states shows a power decay in $\tau/t$
rather than an exponential one as is the case for general, displaced-squeezed
thermal states.

Correlated fluctuations in strongly-coupled binary networks beyond
  equilibrium
David Dahmen Hannah Bos Moritz Helias 
Randomly coupled Ising spins constitute the classical model of collective
phenomena in disordered systems, with applications covering ferromagnetism,
combinatorial optimization, protein folding, stock market dynamics, and social
dynamics. The phase diagram of these systems is obtained in the thermodynamic
limit by averaging over the quenched randomness of the couplings. However, many
applications require the statistics of activity for a single realization of the
possibly asymmetric couplings in finite-sized networks. Examples include
reconstruction of couplings from the observed dynamics, learning in the central
nervous system by correlation-sensitive synaptic plasticity, and representation
of probability distributions for sampling-based inference. The systematic
cumulant expansion for kinetic binary (Ising) threshold units with strong,
random and asymmetric couplings presented here goes beyond mean-field theory
and is applicable outside thermodynamic equilibrium; a system of approximate
non-linear equations predicts average activities and pairwise covariances in
quantitative agreement with full simulations down to hundreds of units. The
linearized theory yields an expansion of the correlation- and response
functions in collective eigenmodes, leads to an efficient algorithm solving the
inverse problem, and shows that correlations are invariant under scaling of the
interaction strengths.

Stellar Population Effects on the Inferred Photon Density at
  Reionization
E. R. Stanway J. J. Eldridge G. D. Becker 
The relationship between stellar populations and the ionizing flux with which
they irradiate their surroundings has profound implications for the evolution
of the intergalactic medium. We quantify the ionizing flux arising from
synthetic stellar populations which incorporate the evolution of interacting
binary stars. We determine that these show ionizing flux boosted by 60 per cent
at 0.05 < Z < 0.3 Z_sun and a more modest 10-20 per cent at near-Solar
metallicities relative to star-forming populations in which stars evolve in
isolation. The relation of ionizing flux to observables such as 1500A continuum
and ultraviolet spectral slope is sensitive to attributes of the stellar
population including age, star formation history and initial mass function. For
a galaxy forming 1 M_sun yr^{-1}, observed at > 100 Myr after the onset of star
formation, we predict a production rate of photons capable of ionizing
hydrogen, N_ion = 1.4 x 10^{53} s^{-1} at Z = Z_sun and 3.5 x 10^{53} s^{-1} at
0.1 Z_sun, assuming a Salpeter-like initial mass function. We evaluate the
impact of these issues on the ionization of the intergalactic medium, finding
that the known galaxy populations can maintain the ionization state of the
Universe back to z ~ 9, assuming that their luminosity functions continue to
M_UV = -10, and that constraints on the intergalactic medium at z ~ 2 - 5 can
be satisfied with modest Lyman continuum photon escape fractions of 4 - 24 per
cent depending on assumed metallicity.

Parametrizations of the global 21-cm signal and parameter estimation
  from single-dipole experiments
Geraint J. A. Harker Jordan Mirocha Jack O. Burns Jonathan R. Pritchard 
One approach to extracting the global 21-cm signal from total-power
measurements at low radio frequencies is to parametrize the different
contributions to the data and then fit for these parameters. We examine
parametrizations of the 21-cm signal itself, and propose one based on modelling
the Lyman-alpha background, IGM temperature and hydrogen ionized fraction using
tanh functions. This captures the shape of the signal from a physical modelling
code better than an earlier parametrization based on interpolating between
maxima and minima of the signal, and imposes a greater level of physical
plausibility. This allows less biased constraints on the turning points of the
signal, even though these are not explicitly fit for. Biases can also be
alleviated by discarding information which is less robustly described by the
parametrization, for example by ignoring detailed shape information coming from
the covariances between turning points or from the high-frequency parts of the
signal, or by marginalizing over the high-frequency parts of the signal by
fitting a more complex foreground model. The fits are sufficiently accurate to
be usable for experiments gathering 1000 h of data, though in this case it may
be important to choose observing windows which do not include the brightest
areas of the foregrounds. Our assumption of pointed, single-antenna
observations and very broad-band fitting makes these results particularly
applicable to experiments such as the Dark Ages Radio Explorer, which would
study the global 21-cm signal from the clean environment of a low lunar orbit,
taking data from the far side.

Band structure and charge doping effects of potassium-adsorbed
  FeSe/SrTiO3 system
Fawei Zheng Li-Li Wang Qi-Kun Xue Ping Zhang 
We theoretically study, through combining the density functional theory and
an unfolding technique, the electronic band structure and the charge doping
effects for the deposition of potassium (K) on multilayer FeSe films grown on
SrTiO3 (001) surface. These results form a theoretical base line for further
detailed studies of low-temperature electronic properties and their multiway
quantum engineering of FeSe thin films. We explain the Fermi surface topology
observed in experiment and formulate the amount of doped electrons as a
function of atomic K coverage. We show that the atomic K deposition efficiently
dopes electrons to top layer FeSe. Both checkerboard and pair-checkerboard
antiferromagnetic (AFM) FeSe layers show electron pockets at M point and no
Fermi pocket at $\Gamma$ point with moderate atomic K coverage. The electron
transfer from K adsorbate to FeSe film introduces a strong electric field,
which leads to a double-Weyl cone structure at M point in the Brillouin zone of
checkerboard-AFM FeSe. We demonstrate that with experimentally accessible heavy
electron doping, an electron-like Fermi pocket will emerge at $\Gamma$ point,
which should manifest itself in modulating the high-temperature
superconductivity of FeSe thin films.

Sebastian Unsleber Sebastian Maier Dara P. S. McCutcheon Yu-Ming He Michael Dambach Manuel Gschrey Jesper Mørk Stephan Reitzenstein Sven Höfling Christian Schneider Martin Kamp 
Resonant excitation of solid state quantum emitters has the potential to
deterministically excite a localized exciton while ensuring a maximally
coherent emission. In this work, we demonstrate the coherent coupling of an
exciton localized in a lithographically positioned, site-controlled
semiconductor quantum dot to an external resonant laser field. For strong
continuous-wave driving we observe the characteristic Mollow triplet and
analyze the Rabi splitting and sideband widths as a function of driving
strength and temperature. The sideband widths increase linearly with
temperature and the square of the driving strength, which we explain via
coupling of the exciton to longitudinal acoustic phonons. We also find an
increase of the Rabi splitting with temperature, which indicates a temperature
induced delocalization of the excitonic wave function resulting in an increase
of the oscillator strength. Finally, we demonstrate coherent control of the
exciton excited state population via pulsed resonant excitation and observe a
damping of the Rabi oscillations with increasing pulse area, which is
consistent with our exciton-photon coupling model. We believe that our work
outlines the possibility to implement fully scalable platforms of solid state
quantum emitters. The latter is one of the key prerequisites for more advanced,
integrated nanophotonic quantum circuits.

Variational Multiscale Nonparametric Regression: Smooth Functions
Markus Grasmair Housen Li Axel Munk 
For the problem of nonparametric regression of smooth functions, we
reconsider and analyze a constrained variational approach, which we call the
MultIscale Nemirovski-Dantzig (MIND) estimator. This can be viewed as a
multiscale extension of the Dantzig selector (\emph{Ann. Statist.}, 35(6):
2313--51, 2009) based on early ideas of Nemirovski (\emph{J. Comput. System
Sci.}, 23:1--11, 1986). MIND minimizes a homogeneous Sobolev norm under the
constraint that the multiresolution norm of the residual is bounded by a
universal threshold. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of
convergence rates of MIND with respect to $L^q$-loss, $1 \le q \le \infty$,
both almost surely and in expectation. To this end, we introduce the method of
approximate source conditions. For a one-dimensional signal, these can be
translated into approximation properties of $B$-splines. A remarkable
consequence is that MIND attains almost minimax optimal rates simultaneously
for a large range of Sobolev and Besov classes, which provides certain
adaptation. Complimentary to the asymptotic analysis, we examine the finite
sample performance of MIND by numerical simulations.

Plasmonics without negative dielectrics
Cristian Della Giovampaola Nader Engheta 
Plasmonic phenomena are exhibited in light-matter interaction involving
materials whose real parts of permittivity functions attain negative values at
operating wavelengths. However, such materials usually suffer from dissipative
losses, thus limiting the performance of plasmon-based optical devices. Here,
we utilize an alternative methodology that mimics a variety of plasmonic
phenomena by exploiting the well-known structural dispersion of electromagnetic
modes in bounded guided-wave structures filled with only materials with
positive permittivity. A key issue in design of such structures is prevention
of mode coupling, which can be achieved by implementing thin metallic wires at
proper interfaces. This method, which is more suitable for lower frequencies,
allows designers to employ conventional dielectrics and highly conductive
metals for which the loss is low at these frequencies, while achieving
plasmonic features. We demonstrate, numerically and analytically, that this
platform can provide surface plasmon polaritons, local plasmonic resonance,
plasmonic cloaking and epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)-based tunneling using
conventional positive-dielectric materials.

Sobolev orthogonal polynomials on the unit ball via outward normal

Antonia M. Delgado Lidia Fernández Doron Lubinsky Teresa E. Pérez Miguel A. Piñar 
We analyse a family of mutually orthogonal polynomials on the unit ball with
respect to an inner product which involves the outward normal derivatives on
the sphere. Using their representation in terms of spherical harmonics,
algebraic and analytic properties will be deduced. First, we deduce explicit
connection formulas relating classical multivariate ball polynomials and our
family of Sobolev orthogonal polynomials. Then explicit representations for the
norms and the kernels will be obtained. Finally, the asymptotic behaviour of
the corresponding Christoffel functions is studied.

Full Current Statistics for a Disordered Open Exclusion Process
Arvind Ayyer 
We consider the nonabelian sandpile model defined on directed trees by Ayyer,
Schilling, Steinberg and Thi\'ery (Commun. Math. Phys, 2013) and restrict it to
the special case of a one-dimensional lattice of $n$ sites which has open
boundaries and disordered hopping rates. We focus on the joint distribution of
the integrated currents across each bond simultaneously, and calculate its
cumulant generating function exactly. Surprisingly, the process conditioned on
seeing specified currents across each bond turns out to be a renormalised
version of the same process. We also remark on a duality property of the large
deviation function. Lastly, all eigenvalues and both Perron eigenvectors of the
tilted generator are determined.

Dynamics of vortices with magnetic impurities
Alexander Cockburn Steffen Krusch Abera A. Muhamed 
We investigate the dynamics of BPS vortices in the presence of magnetic
impurities taking the form of axially-symmetric localised lumps and
delta-functions. We present numerical results for vortices on flat space, as
well as exact results for vortices on hyperbolic space in the presence of
delta-function impurities. In fact, delta-function impurities of appropriate
strength can be captured within the moduli space approximation by keeping one
or more of the vortices fixed. We also show that previous work on vortices on
the 2-sphere extends naturally to the inclusion of delta-function impurities.

Orbital magnetic susceptibility of graphene and MoS2
Ángel Gutiérrez-Rubio Tobias Stauber Guillermo Gómez-Santos Reza Asgari Francisco Guinea 
We calculate the orbital magnetic susceptibility $\chi_{\mathrm{orb}}$ for an
8-band tight-binding model of gapless and gapped graphene using Green's
functions. Analogously, we study $\chi_{\mathrm{orb}}$ for a $\mathrm{MoS_2}$
12-band model. For both materials, we unravel the character of the processes
involved in the magnetic response by looking at the contribution at each point
of the Brillouin zone. By this, a clear distinction between intra- and
interband excitations is generally possible and we are able to predict
qualitative features of $\chi_{\mathrm{orb}}$ only through the knowledge of the
band structure. The study is complemented by comparing the magnetic response
with that of 2-band lattice Hamiltonians which reduce to the Dirac and
Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) models in the continuum limit.

Dark energy as a kinematic effect
H. Jennen J. G. Pereira 
We present a generalization of teleparallel gravity that is consistent with
local spacetime kinematics regulated by the de Sitter group $SO(1,4)$. The
mathematical structure of teleparallel gravity is shown to be given by a
nonlinear Riemann-Cartan geometry without curvature, which inspires us to build
the generalization on top of a de Sitter-Cartan geometry with a cosmological
function. The cosmological function is given its own dynamics and naturally
emerges nonminimally coupled to the gravitational field in a manner akin to
teleparallel dark energy models or scalar-tensor theories in general
relativity. New in the theory here presented, the cosmological function gives
rise to a kinematic contribution in the deviation equation for the world lines
of adjacent free-falling particles. While having its own dynamics, dark energy
manifests itself in the local kinematics of spacetime.

Towards accurate rescaling of a halo mass function
Victoria Yankelevich Sergey Pilipenko 
We investigate the precision within which a simulated dark matter halo mass
function can be rescaled to a different set of cosmological parameters. Our
tests show that the accuracy almost linearly depends on the difference of the
cosmological parameters and amounts to few percent in the case of WMAP5 and
PLANCK parameters. The rescaling allows thus to obtain a mass function with
better precision than the one given by Sheth-Mo-Tormen approximation and even
more modern fits currently used in literature.

Robust Quantitative Comparative Statics for a Multimarket Paradox
Tobias Harks Philipp von Falkenhausen 
We introduce a quantitative approach to comparative statics that allows to
bound the maximum effect of an exogenous parameter change on a system's
equilibrium. The motivation for this approach is a well known paradox in
multimarket Cournot competition, where a positive price shock on a monopoly
market may actually reduce the monopolist's profit. We use our approach to
quantify for the first time the worst case profit reduction for multimarket
oligopolies exposed to arbitrary positive price shocks. For markets with affine
price functions and firms with convex cost technologies, we show that the
relative profit loss of any firm is at most 25% no matter how many firms
compete in the oligopoly. We further investigate the impact of positive price
shocks on total profit of all firms as well as on social welfare. We find tight
bounds also for these measures showing that total profit and social welfare
decreases by at most 25% and 16.6%, respectively. Finally, we show that in our
model, mixed, correlated and coarse correlated equilibria are essentially
unique, thus, all our bounds apply to these game solutions as well.

Qualitative behavior of solutions to cross-diffusion systems from
  population dynamics
Ansgar Jüngel Nicola Zamponi 
A general class of cross-diffusion systems for two population species in a
bounded domain with no-flux boundary conditions and Lotka-Volterra-type source
terms is analyzed. Although the diffusion coefficients are assumed to depend
linearly on the population densities, the equations are strongly coupled.
Generally, the diffusion matrix is neither symmetric nor positive definite.
Three main results are proved: the existence of global uniformly bounded weak
solutions, their convergence to the constant steady state in the weak
competition case, and the uniqueness of weak solutions. The results hold under
appropriate conditions on the diffusion parameters which are made explicit and
which contain simplified Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto population models as a
special case. The proofs are based on entropy methods, which rely on convexity
properties of suitable Lyapunov functionals.

Green's function for elliptic systems: moment bounds
Peter Bella Arianna Giunti 
We study estimates of the Green's function in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \ge 2$,
for the linear second order elliptic equation in divergence form with variable
uniformly elliptic coefficients. In the case $d \ge 3$, we obtain estimates on
the Green's function, its gradient, and the second mixed derivatives which
scale optimally in space, in terms of the "minimal radius" $r_*$ introduced in
[Gloria, Neukamm, and Otto: A regularity theory for random elliptic operators;
ArXiv e-prints (2014)]. As an application, our result implies optimal
stochastic Gaussian bounds in the realm of homogenization of equations with
random coefficient fields with finite range of dependence. In two dimensions,
where in general the Green's function does not exist, we construct its gradient
and show the corresponding estimates on the gradient and mixed second
derivatives. Since we do not use any scalar methods in the argument, the result
holds in the case of uniformly elliptic systems as well.

Discrete Equilibrium Sampling with Arbitrary Nonequilibrium Processes
Firas Hamze Evgeny Andryash 
We present a novel framework for performing statistical sampling, expectation
estimation, and partition function approximation using \emph{arbitrary}
heuristic stochastic processes defined over discrete state spaces. Using a
highly parallel construction we call the \emph{sequential constraining
process}, we are able to simultaneously generate states with the heuristic
process and accurately estimate their probabilities, even when they are far too
small to be realistically inferred by direct counting. After showing that both
theoretically correct importance sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo are
possible using the sequential constraining process, we integrate it into a
methodology called \emph{state space sampling}, extending the ideas of state
space search from computer science to the sampling context. The methodology
comprises a dynamic data structure that constructs a robust Bayesian model of
the statistics generated by the heuristic process subject to an accuracy
constraint, the posterior Kullback-Leibler divergence. Sampling from the
dynamic structure will generally yield partial states, which are completed by
recursively calling the heuristic to refine the structure and resuming the
sampling. Our experiments on various Ising models suggest that state space
sampling enables heuristic state generation with accurate probability
estimates, demonstrated by illustrating the convergence of a simulated
annealing process to the Boltzmann distribution with increasing run length.
Consequently, heretofore unprecedented direct importance sampling using the
\emph{final} (marginal) distribution of a generic stochastic process is
allowed, potentially augmenting the range of algorithms at the Monte Carlo
practitioner's disposal.

Random walks on infinite percolation clusters in models with long-range
  correlations
Artem Sapozhnikov 
For a general class of percolation models with long-range correlations on
$\mathbb Z^d$, $d\geq 2$, introduced in arXiv:1212.2885, we establish
regularity conditions of Barlow arXiv:math/0302004 that mesoscopic subballs of
all large enough balls in the unique infinite percolation cluster have regular
volume growth and satisfy a weak Poincar\'e inequality. As immediate
corollaries, we deduce quenched heat kernel bounds, parabolic Harnack
inequality, and finiteness of the dimension of harmonic functions with at most
polynomial growth. Heat kernel bounds and the quenched invariance principle of
arXiv:1310.4764 allow to extend various other known results about Bernoulli
percolation by mimicking their proofs, for instance, the local central limit
theorem of arXiv:0810.2467 or the result of arXiv:1111.4853 that the dimension
of at most linear harmonic functions on the infinite cluster is $d+1$.
  In terms of specific models, all these results are new for random
interlacements at every level in any dimension $d\geq 3$, as well as for the
vacant set of random interlacements arXiv:0704.2560, arXiv:0808.3344 and the
level sets of the Gaussian free field arXiv:1202.5172 in the regime of the
so-called local uniqueness (which is believed to coincide with the whole
supercritical regime for these models).

A theoretical investigation on the transport properties of armchair

Hongyu Ge Guo Wang Yi Liao 
Armchair biphenylene nanoribbons are investigated by using density functional
theory. The nanoribbon that contains one biphenylene subunit in a unit cell is
a semiconductor with a direct band gap larger than 1 eV, while that containing
four biphenylene subunits is a metal. The semiconducting nanoribbon has high
electron mobility of 57174 cm2V-1s-1, superior to armchair graphene
nanoribbons. Negative differential resistance behavior is observed in two
electronic devices composed of the semiconducting and metallic nanoribbons. The
on/off ratios are in the order of 10^3. All these indicate that armchair
biphenylene nanoribbons are potential candidates for ultra-small logic devices.

existence of different types of local clusters in the liquid.

Geometric construction of Quantum Hall clustering Hamiltonians
Ching Hua Lee Zlatko Papić Ronny Thomale 
Many fractional quantum Hall wave functions are known to be unique and
highest-density zero modes of certain "pseudopotential" Hamiltonians. Examples
include the Read-Rezayi series (in particular, the Laughlin, Moore-Read and
Read-Rezayi Z_3 states), and more exotic non-unitary (Haldane-Rezayi, Gaffnian
states) or irrational states (Haffnian state). While a systematic method to
construct such Hamiltonians is available for the infinite plane or sphere
geometry, its generalization to manifolds such as the cylinder or torus, where
relative angular momentum is not an exact quantum number, has remained an open
problem. Here we develop a geometric approach for constructing pseudopotential
Hamiltonians in a universal manner that naturally applies to all geometries.
Our method generalizes to the multicomponent SU(n) cases with a combination of
spin or pseudospin (layer, subband, valley) degrees of freedom. We demonstrate
the utility of the approach by several examples, including certain non-Abelian
multicomponent states whose parent Hamiltonians were previously unknown, and
verify the method by numerically computing their entanglement properties.

The advent of geolocated ICT technologies opens the possibility of exploring
how people use space in cities, bringing an important new tool for urban
scientists and planners, especially for regions where data is scarce or not
available. Here we apply a functional network approach to determine land use
patterns from mobile phone records. The versatility of the method allows us to
run a systematic comparison between Spanish cities of various sizes. The method
detects four major land use types that correspond to different temporal
patterns. The proportion of these types, their spatial organization and scaling
show a strong similarity between all cities that breaks down at a very local
scale, where land use mixing is specific to each urban area. Finally, we
introduce a model inspired by Schelling's segregation, able to explain and
reproduce these results with simple interaction rules between different land
uses.

We investigate Bayesian non-parametric inference for $\Lambda$-coalescent
processes parametrised by probability measures on the unit interval, and
provide an implementable, provably consistent MCMC inference algorithm. We give
verifiable criteria on the prior for posterior consistency when observations
form a time series, and prove that any non-trivial prior is inconsistent when
all observations are contemporaneous. We then show that the likelihood given a
data set of size $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is constant across $\Lambda$-measures whose
leading $n - 2$ moments agree, and focus on inferring truncated sequences of
moments. We provide a large class of functionals which can be extremised using
finite computation given a credibility region of posterior truncated moment
sequences, and a pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for sampling the
posterior. Finally, we compare the efficiency of the exact and noisy
pseudo-marginal algorithms with and without delayed acceptance acceleration
using a simulation study.

Transition metals doped CuAlSe2 for promising intermediate band
  materials
Tingting Wang Xiaoguang Li Wenjie Li Li Huang Ya Cheng Jun Cui Hailin Luo Guohua Zhong 
Introducing an isolated intermediate band (IB) into a wide band gap
semiconductor can potentially improve the optical absorption of the material
beyond the Shockley-Queisser limitation for solar cells. Here, we present a
systematic study of the thermodynamic stability, electronic structures, and
optical properties of transition metals (M = Ti, V, and Fe) doped CuAlSe2 for
potential IB thin film solar cells, by adopting the first-principles
calculation based on the hybrid functional method. We found from chemical
potential analysis that for all dopants considered, the stable doped phase only
exits when the Al atom is substituted. More importantly, with this
substitution, the IB feature is determined by $3d$ electronic nature of M^{3+}
ion, and the electronic configuration of 3d^1 can drive a optimum IB that
possesses half-filled character and suitable subbandgap from valence band or
conduction band. We further show that Ti-doped CuAlSe2 is the more promising
candidate for IB materials since the resulted IB in it is half filled and extra
absorption peaks occurs in the optical spectrum accompanied with a largely
enhanced light absorption intensity. The result offers a understanding for IB
induced by transition metals into CuAlSe2 and is significant to fabricate the
related IB materials.

Based on the density functional theory with hybrid functional approach, we

Mg, and Ca; X = S and Se) alloy, and have further investigated the electronic
and optical properties of stable Cu2MgSnS4 and Cu2MgSnSe4 phases. Thermal
stability analysis indicates that Cu2MgSnS4 and Cu2MgSnSe4 are
thermodynamically stable, while Cu2CaSnS4 and Cu2CaSnSe4 are unstable. The
ground state configuration of the compound changes from kesterite into stannite
structure when Zn atoms are substitued by larger Mg or Ca atoms. An energy
separation between stannite and kesterite phase similar to that of CZTS is
observed. Calculated electronic structures and optical properties suggest that
Cu2MgSnS4 and Cu2MgSnSe4 can be efficient photovoltaic materials.

Systematic study of complete fusion suppression in reactions involving
  weakly bound nuclei at energies above the Coulomb barrier
Bing Wang Wei-Juan Zhao Alexis Diaz-Torres En-Guang Zhao Shan-Gui Zhou 
Complete fusion excitation functions of reactions involving breakup are
studied by using the empirical coupled-channel (ECC) model with breakup effects
considered. An exponential function with two parameters is adopted to describe
the prompt-breakup probability in the ECC model. These two parameters are fixed
by fitting the measured prompt-breakup probability or the complete fusion cross
sections. The suppression of complete fusion at energies above the Coulomb
barrier is studied by comparing the data with the predictions from the ECC
model without the breakup channel considered. The results show that the
suppression of complete fusion are roughly independent of the target for the
reactions involving the same projectile.

Renormalization Scheme Dependence in b->u Semileptonic Decays
D. G. C. McKeon 
After reviewing how the renormalization group equation can be used to sum
logarithmic corrections to the decay rate for the semi-leptonic process b->u
when using minimal subtraction, we consider renormalization scheme dependence
for this calculation when employing this renor- malization scheme. In this
calculation, an ambiguity resides in the running strong coupling and in the
running b quark mass. The ambiguity usually associated with the renormalization
mass scale mu is shown to cancel. It is demonstrated how in one renormalization
scheme, there are only leading-log contributions to this decay rate. Another
choice of renormalization scheme results in the decay rate being expressed in
terms of the two-loop contribution to the beta-function associated with the
strong coupling and the one-loop contribution to the anomalous mass dimension
as well as a set of renormalization scheme invariant parameters.

Necessary optimality conditions for optimal control problems with
  nonsmooth mixed state and control constraints
An Li Jane Ye 
In this paper we study an optimal control problem with nonsmooth mixed state
and control constraints. In most of the existing results, the necessary
optimality condition for optimal control problems with mixed state and control
constraints are derived under the Mangasarian-Fromovitz condition and under the
assumption that the state and control constraint functions are smooth. In this
paper we derive necessary optimality conditions for problems with nonsmooth
mixed state and control constraints under constraint qualifications based on
pseudo-Lipschitz continuity and calmness of certain set-valued maps. The
necessary conditions are stratified, in the sense that they are asserted on
precisely the domain upon which the hypotheses (and the optimality) are assumed
to hold. Moreover necessary optimality conditions with an Euler inclusion
taking an explicit multiplier form are derived for certain cases.

Contact geometric descriptions of vector fields on dually flat spaces
  and their applications in electric circuit models and nonequilibrium
  statistical mechanics
Shin-itiro Goto 
Contact geometry has been applied to various mathematical sciences, and it
has been proposed that a contact manifold and a strictly convex function induce
a dually flat space that is used in information geometry. Here, such a dually
flat space is related to a Legendre submanifold in a contact manifold. In this
paper contact geometric descriptions of vector fields on dually flat spaces are
proposed on the basis of the theory of contact Hamiltonian vector fields. Based
on these descriptions, two ways of lifting vector fields on Legendre
submanifolds to contact manifolds are given. For some classes of these lifted
vector fields, invariant measures in contact manifolds and stability analysis
around Legendre submanifolds are explicitly given. Throughout this paper,
Legendre duality is explicitly stated. In addition, to show how to apply these
general methodologies to applied mathematical disciplines, electric circuit
models and some examples taken from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics are
analyzed.

Multivariate Functional Regression Models for Epistasis Analysis
Futao Zhang Dan Xie Meimei Liang Momiao Xiong 
To date, most genetic analyses of phenotypes have focused on analyzing single
traits or, analyzing each phenotype independently. However, joint epistasis
analysis of multiple complementary traits will increase statistical power, and
hold the key to understanding the complicated genetic structure of the complex
diseases. Despite their importance in uncovering the genetic structure of
complex traits, the statistical methods for identifying epistasis in multiple
phenotypes remains fundamentally unexplored. To fill this gap, we formulate a
test for interaction between two gens in multiple quantitative trait analysis
as a multiple functional regression (MFRG) in which the genotype functions
(genetic variant profiles) are defined as a function of the genomic position of
the genetic variants. We use large scale simulations to calculate its type I
error rates for testing interaction between two genes with multiple phenotypes
and to compare its power with multivariate pair-wise interaction analysis and
single trait interaction analysis by a single variate functional regression
model. To further evaluate its performance, the MFRG for epistasis analysis is
applied to five phenotypes and exome sequence data from the NHLBI Exome
Sequencing Project (ESP) to detect pleiotropic epistasis. A total of 136 pairs
of genes that formed a genetic interaction network showed significant evidence
of epistasis influencing five traits. The results demonstrate that the joint
interaction analysis of multiple phenotypes has much higher power to detect
interaction than the interaction analysis of single trait and may open a new
direction to fully uncovering the genetic structure of multiple phenotypes.

Besov spaces of self-affine lattice tilings and pointwise regularity
Koichi Saka 
We investigate Besov spaces of self-affine tilings of ${\Bbb R}^{n}$ and
discuss various characterizations of those Besov spaces. We see what is a
finite set of functions which generates the Besov spaces from a view of
multiresolution approximation on self-affine lattice tilings of ${\Bbb R}^{n}$.
Using this result we give a generalization of already known characterizations
of Besov spaces given by wavelet expansion and we apply to study the pointwise
H${\ddot {\rm o}}$lder space. Furthermore we give descriptions of scaling
exponents measured by Besov spaces, and estimations of a pointwise H${\ddot
{\rm o}}$lder exponent to compute the pointwise scaling exponent of several
oscillatory functions.

A New Statistical Framework for Genetic Pleiotropic Analysis of High
  Dimensional Phenotype Data
Panpan Wang Mohammad Rahman Li Jin Momiao Xiong 
The widely used genetic pleiotropic analysis of multiple phenotypes are often
designed for examining the relationship between common variants and a few
phenotypes. They are not suited for both high dimensional phenotypes and high
dimensional genotype (next-generation sequencing) data. To overcome these
limitations, we develop sparse structural equation models (SEMs) as a general
framework for a new paradigm of genetic analysis of multiple phenotypes. To
incorporate both common and rare variants into the analysis, we extend the
traditional multivariate SEMs to sparse functional SEMs. To deal with high
dimensional phenotype and genotype data, we employ functional data analysis and
the alternative direction methods of multiplier (ADMM) techniques to reduce
data dimension and improve computational efficiency. Using large scale
simulations we showed that the proposed methods have higher power to detect
true causal genetic pleiotropic structure than other existing methods.
Simulations also demonstrate that the gene-based pleiotropic analysis has
higher power than the single variant-based pleiotropic analysis. The proposed
method is applied to exome sequence data from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing
Project (ESP) with 11 phenotypes, which identifies a network with 137 genes
connected to 11 phenotypes and 341 edges. Among them, 114 genes showed
pleiotropic genetic effects and 45 genes were reported to be associated with
phenotypes in the analysis or other cardiovascular disease (CVD) related
phenotypes in the literature.

Protecting coherence of a single quantum dot system via non-Markovian
  coherent feedback
Shibei Xue Re-Bing Wu Michael R. Hush Tzyh-Jong Tarn 
This paper presents a non-Markovian coherent feedback control scheme for
stabilizing a single quantum dot system. The feedback loop is closed via
quantum tunneling process between the natural source and drain baths of the
quantum dot. The exact feedback-controlled non-Markovian Langevin equation is
derived to describe the dynamics of the quantum dot. Since the memory function
in the Langevin equation is a nonlinear function of the feedback coupling
strength, a method named root locus of the Green's function is presented to
analyze the non-Markovian dynamics in the frequency domain. This method
graphically reveals the mechanism of decoherence suppression induced by
non-Markovian coherent feedback, which is verified by an example of single
quantum dot systems.

An optical spectrum of a large isolated gas-phase PAH cation: C78H26+
Junfeng Zhen Giacomo Mulas Anthony Bonnamy Christine Joblin 
A gas-phase optical spectrum of a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
cation - C78H26 +- in the 410-610 nm range is presented. This large
all-benzenoid PAH should be large enough to be stable with respect to
photodissociation in the harsh conditions prevailing in the interstellar medium
(ISM). The spectrum is obtained via multi-photon dissociation (MPD)
spectroscopy of cationic C78H26 stored in the Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron
Resonance (FT-ICR) cell using the radiation from a mid-band optical parametric
oscillator (OPO) laser. The experimental spectrum shows two main absorption
peaks at 431 nm and 516 nm, in good agreement with a theoretical spectrum
computed via time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). DFT
calculations indicate that the equilibrium geometry, with the absolute minimum
energy, is of lowered, nonplanar C2 symmetry instead of the more symmetric
planar D2h symmetry that is usually the minimum for similar PAHs of smaller
size. This kind of slightly broken symmetry could produce some of the fine
structure observed in some diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). It can also favor
the folding of C78H26 + fragments and ultimately theformation of fullerenes.
This study opens up the possibility to identify the most promising candidates
for DIBs amongst large cationic PAHs.

Atom-Field Entanglement in Cavity QED: Nonlinearity and Saturation
Robert Rogers Nick Cummings Leno Pedrotti Perry Rice 
We investigate the degree of entanglement between an atom and a driven cavity
mode, in the presence of dissipation. Previous work has shown that in the limit
of weak driving fields, the steady state entanglement is proportional to the
square of the driving intensity. This quadratic dependence is due to the
generation of entanglement by the creation of pairs of photons/excitations. In
this work we investigate the entanglement between an atom and a cavity in the
presence of multiple photons. Nonlinearity of the atomic response is needed to
generate entanglement, but as that nonlinearity saturates the entanglement
vanishes. We posit that this is due to spontaneous emission, which puts the
atom in the ground state and the atom-field state into a direct product state.
An intermediate value of the driving field, near the field that saturates the
atomic response, optimizes the atom-field entanglement. In a parameter regime
for which multiphoton resonances occur, we find that entanglement recurs at
those resonances. \\cite{Shamailov-10} In this regime, we find that the
entanglement decreases with increaing photon number. We also investigate, in
the bimodal regime of Alsing et. al.\cite{Alsing-91-DressedState}
\cite{Alsing-92-DSS}\\cite{Carm-15-X}, the entanglement as a function of atom
and/or cavity detuning. Here we find that there is evidence of a phase
transition in the entanglement, which occurs at $2\epsilon/g \geq 1$.

An explicit upper bound is derived for the modulus of divided difference for

an immediate application, an error estimate for complex polynomial
interpolation on a Jordan arc (or a Jordan curve) is given, which extends the
well-known error estimate for polynomial interpolation on the unit interval.
Moreover, this upper bound is independent of the parametrization of the curve.

Dynamics of Directional Drift in Brownian Motion of Molecules with
  Broken Symmetry in Dilute Solutions
Nan Sheng YuSong Tu Pan Guo RongZheng Wan ZuoWei Wang HaiPing Fang 
We show by three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations that the Brownian
motion of molecules/particles with broken symmetry in very dilute solutions
includes a directional drifting process. The time-dependent probability
distribution function of the center of mass position of such a particle shows a
bias towards its original orientation direction at short time scales, leading
to a non-zero directional mean displacement whose value saturates as the
rotational autocorrelation function of the particle decays completely. For
model particles shaped as triangular pyramids, the saturated value of the drift
is found to grow almost linearly with the particle size. Our detailed force
analysis reveals that the physical origin of the drifting behavior arises from
the imbalanced forces acting on the model particles by surrounding solvent
molecules, which generate an effective net force pointing to the original
orientation direction. The directional motion of the particle takes place in
the crossover region from ballistic to diffusive motion, which is a
pre-diffusive behavior beyond the scope of conventional diffusion theories
using Einstein relationship. A phenomenological model description of the
drifting behavior has been proposed based on the coupling with rotational
relaxation. Our simulation and theoretical finding thus provide novel insights
into the fundamentals of particle diffusion and the understanding of various
physical, chemical and biological processes that usually happen in nanoscale
space within a finite time.

We construct additional symmetries of the EBTH and describe explicitly their

In particular, we obtain infinitesimal symmetries of the EBTH that act on the
tau-function as a subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra, generalizing those of

In theory of superconducting junctions, Green's function has an important
role to obtain Andreev bound states, local density of states and Josephson
current in a systematic way. In this article, we show how to construct Green's
function on the surface of topological insulator following McMillan's formalism
where the energy spectrum of electrons obeys a linear dispersion. For a model
of superconductor (S)/ferromagnet (F)/normal metal (N) junction, we show that

states and pair amplitude of odd-frequency pairing. We also derive an extended
Furusaki-Tsukada's formula of d.c. Josephson current in S/F/S junctions. The
obtained Josephson current depends on the direction and magnitude of the

Exact quantization of the Milson potential via Romanovski-Routh
  polynomials
Gregory Natanson 
The paper re-examines Milson's analysis of the rational Sturm-Liouville (RSL)
problem with two complex conjugated regular singular points -i and +i by taking
advantage of Stevenson's complex linear-fraction transformation S(y) of the
variable y restricted to the real axis. It was explicitly demonstrated that
Stevenson's hypergeometric polynomials in a complex argument S are nothing but
Romanovsky polynomials converted from y to S. The use of Stevenson's
mathematical arguments unambiguously confirmed 'exact solvability' of the
Milson potential. It was revealed that the Milson potential has two branches
referred to as 'inside' and 'outside' depending on positions of zeros of the
so-called 'tangent polynomial' (TP) relative to the unit circle. The two
intersect along the shape-invariant Gendenshtein (Scarf II) potential. The
remarkable feature of the RCSLE associated with the inner branch of the Milson
potential (as well as its shape-invariant limit) is that it has two sequences
of nodeless almost-everywhere holomorphic (AEH) solutions which can be used as
factorization functions (FFs) for constructing new quantized-by-polynomials
potentials. In case of the Gendenshtein potential complex-conjugated
characteristic exponents (ChExps) at finite singular points of the given RCSLE
become energy independent so that each polynomial sequence turns into a finite
set of orthogonal polynomials. This confirms Quesne's conjecture [J. Math.
Phys. 54 122103 (2013)] that the 'Case III' polynomials discovered by her can
be used for constructing orthogonal polynomials of novel type.

Uniform analytic properties of representation zeta functions of finitely
  generated nilpotent groups
Duong Hoang Dung Christopher Voll 
Let $G$ be a finitely generated torsion-free nilpotent group. The
representation zeta function $\zeta_G(s)$ of $G$ enumerates twist isoclasses of
finite-dimensional irreducible complex representations of $G$. We prove that
$\zeta_G(s)$ has rational abscissa of convergence $a(G)$ and may be
meromorphically continued to the left of $a(G)$ and that, on the line
$\{s\in\mathbb{C} \mid \textrm{Re}(s) = a(G)\}$, the continued function is
holomorphic except for a pole at $s=a(G)$. A Tauberian theorem yields a precise
asymptotic result on the representation growth of $G$ in terms of the position
and order of this pole.
  We obtain these results as a consequence of a more general result
establishing uniform analytic properties of representation zeta functions of
finitely generated nilpotent groups of the form $\mathbf{G}(\mathcal{O})$,
where $\mathbf{G}$ is a unipotent group scheme defined in terms of a nilpotent
Lie lattice over the ring $\mathcal{O}$ of integers of a number field. This
allows us to show, in particular, that the abscissae of convergence of the
representation zeta functions of such groups and their pole orders are
invariants of $\mathbf{G}$, independent of $\mathcal{O}$.

Shape-constrained uncertainty quantification in unfolding steeply
  falling elementary particle spectra
Mikael Kuusela Philip B. Stark 
The high energy physics unfolding problem is an important statistical inverse
problem arising in data analysis at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The
problem arises in making nonparametric inferences about a particle spectrum
from measurements smeared by the finite resolution of the particle detectors.
Existing unfolding methodology has major practical limitations stemming from ad
hoc discretization and regularization of the problem. As a result, confidence
intervals derived using the current methods can have significantly lower
coverage than expected. In this work, we regularize the problem by imposing
physically justified shape constraints. We quantify the uncertainty by
constructing a nonparametric confidence set for the true spectrum consisting of
all spectra that satisfy the shape constraints and that predict observations
within an appropriately calibrated level of fit to the data. Projecting that
set produces simultaneous confidence intervals for all functionals of the
spectrum, including averages within bins. The confidence intervals have
guaranteed frequentist finite-sample coverage in the important and challenging
class of unfolding problems with steeply falling particle spectra. We
demonstrate the efficacy of the method using simulations designed to mimic the
unfolding of the inclusive jet transverse momentum spectrum at the Large Hadron
Collider. The shape-constrained intervals provide usefully tight conservative
confidence intervals, while the conventional methods suffer from major
undercoverage.

Non-Convex Distributed Optimization
Tatiana Tatarenko Behrouz Touri 
We study distributed non-convex optimization on a time-varying multi-agent
network. Each node has access to its own smooth local cost function, and the
collective goal is to minimize the sum of these functions. We generalize the
results obtained previously to the case of non-convex functions. Under some
additional technical assumptions on the gradients we prove the convergence of
the distributed push-sum algorithm to some critical point of the objective
function. By utilizing perturbations on the update process, we show the almost
sure convergence of the perturbed dynamics to a local minimum of the global
objective function. Our analysis shows that this noised procedure converges at
a rate of $O(1/t)$.

We present a first look at the SCUBA-2 observations of three sub-regions of

the JCMT Gould Belt Legacy Survey. We identify 29, 564, and 322 dense cores in
L1622, NGC 2023/2024, and NGC 2068/2071 respectively, using the SCUBA-2 850
micron map, and present their basic properties, including their peak fluxes,
total fluxes, and sizes, and an estimate of the corresponding 450 micron peak
fluxes and total fluxes, using the FellWalker source extraction algorithm.
Assuming a constant temperature of 20 K, the starless dense cores have a mass
function similar to that found in previous dense core analyses, with a
Salpeter-like slope at the high-mass end. The majority of cores appear stable
to gravitational collapse when considering only thermal pressure; indeed, most
of the cores which have masses above the thermal Jeans mass are already
associated with at least one protostar. At higher cloud column densities, above
1-2 x 10^23 cm^-2, most of the mass is found within dense cores, while at lower
cloud column densities, below 1 x 10^23 cm^-2, this fraction drops to 10% or
lower. Overall, the fraction of dense cores associated with a protostar is
quite small (<8%), but becomes larger for the densest and most centrally
concentrated cores. NGC 2023 / 2024 and NGC 2068/2071 appear to be on the path
to forming a significant number of stars in the future, while L1622 has little
additional mass in dense cores to form many new stars.

Generalized Conjugate Gradient Methods for $\ell_1$ Regularized Convex
  Quadratic Programming with Finite Convergence
Zhaosong Lu Xiaojun Chen 
The conjugate gradient (CG) method is an efficient iterative method for
solving large-scale strongly convex quadratic programming (QP). In this paper
we propose some generalized CG (GCG) methods for solving the
$\ell_1$-regularized (possibly not strongly) convex QP that terminate at an
optimal solution in a finite number of iterations. At each iteration, our
methods first identify a face of an orthant and then either perform an exact
line search along the direction of the negative projected minimum-norm
subgradient of the objective function or execute a CG subroutine that conducts
a sequence of CG iterations until a CG iterate crosses the boundary of this
face or an approximate minimizer of over this face or a subface is found. We
determine which type of step should be taken by comparing the magnitude of some
components of the minimum-norm subgradient of the objective function to that of
its rest components. Our analysis on finite convergence of these methods makes
use of an error bound result and some key properties of the aforementioned
exact line search and the CG subroutine. We also show that the proposed methods
are capable of finding an approximate solution of the problem by allowing some
inexactness on the execution of the CG subroutine. The overall arithmetic
operation cost of our GCG methods for finding an $\epsilon$-optimal solution
depends on $\epsilon$ in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$, which is superior to the
accelerated proximal gradient method [2,23] that depends on $\epsilon$ in
$O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$. In addition, our GCG methods can be extended
straightforwardly to solve box-constrained convex QP with finite convergence.
Numerical results demonstrate that our methods are very favorable for solving

The perturbative QCD factorization of $ργ^{\star} \to ρ$
Ya-lan Zhang Shan Cheng Jun Hua Zhen-jun Xiao 
In this paper we firstly demonstrate step by step that the factorization
hypothesis is valid at the next-to-leading order (NLO) for the exclusive
process $\rho \gamma^{\star} \to \rho$ by employing the collinear factorization
approach, and then extend this proof to the case of the $k_T$ factorization by
taking into account the transversal momentum of the light external quark
(anti-quark) lines in the $\rho$ meson. At the NLO level, we then show that the
soft divergences from different sub-diagrams will be canceled each other in the
quark level, while the remaining collinear divergences can be absorbed into the
NLO meson wave functions. The full NLO amplitudes can therefore be factorized
as the convolution of the NLO wave functions $ \Phi^{(1)}_{\rho}$ and the
infrared-finite leading order (LO) hard kernels $G^0_{X,IJ,kl}$ in the $k_T$
factorization. We also write down the polarized NLO $\rho$ meson wave functions
in the form of nonlocal hadron matrix elements with the gauge factor integral
path deviating from the light cone. These NLO $\rho$ meson wave functions can
be used to calculate the NLO hard corrections to some relevant exclusive
processes, such as $B \to \rho$ transition.

Cleaning Schedule Optimization of Heat Exchanger Networks Using Particle
  Swarm Optimization
Totok R. Biyanto Sumitra Wira Suganda Matraji Yerry Susatio Heri Justiono Sarwono 
Oil refinery is one of industries that require huge energy consumption. The
today technology advance requires energy saving. Heat integration is a method
used to minimize the energy comsumption though the implementation of Heat
Exchanger Network (HEN). CPT is one of types of Heat Exchanger Network (HEN)
that functions to recover the heat in the flow of product or waste. HEN
comprises a number of heat exchangers (HEs) that are serially connected.
However, the presence of fouling in the heat exchanger has caused the decline
of the performance of both heat exchangers and all heat exchanger networks.
Fouling can not be avoided. However, it can be mitigated. In industry, periodic
heat exchanger cleaning is the most effective and widely used mitigation
technique. On the other side, a very frequent cleaning of heat exchanger can be
much costly in maintenance and lost of production. In this way, an accurate
optimization technique of cleaning schedule interval of heat exchanger is very
essential. Commonly, this technique involves three elements: model to simulate
the heat exchanger network, representative fouling model to describe the
fouling behavior and suitable optimization algorithm to solve the problem of
clening schedule interval for heat exchanger network. This paper describe the
optimization of interval cleaning schedule of HEN within the 44-month period
using PSO (particle swarm optimization). The number of iteration used to
achieve the convergent is 100 iterations and the fitness value in PSO
correlated with the amount of heat recovery, cleaning cost, and additional
pumping cost. The saving after the optimization of cleaning schedule of HEN in
this research achieved at $ 1.236 millions or 23% of maximum potential savings.

Expressive power of infinitary [0, 1]-valued logics
Christopher J. Eagle 
We consider model-theoretic properties related to the expressive power of
three analogues of $L_{\omega_1, \omega}$ for metric structures. We give an
example showing that one of these infinitary logics is strictly more expressive
than the other two, but also show that all three have the same elementary
equivalence relation for complete separable metric structures. We then prove
that a continuous function on a complete separable metric structure is
automorphism invariant if and only if it is definable in the more expressive
logic. Several of our results are related to the existence of Scott sentences
for complete separable metric structures.

Two-dimensional colloidal fluids exhibiting pattern formation
Blesson Chacko Christopher Chalmers Andrew J. Archer 
Fluids with competing short range attraction and long range repulsive
interactions between the particles can exhibit a variety of microphase
separated structures. We develop a lattice-gas (generalised Ising) model and
analyse the phase diagram using Monte Carlo computer simulations and also with
density functional theory (DFT). The DFT predictions for the structures formed
are in good agreement with the results from the simulations, which occur in the
portion of the phase diagram where the theory predicts the uniform fluid to be
linearly unstable. However, the mean-field DFT does not correctly describe the
transitions between the different morphologies, which the simulations show to
be analogous to micelle formation. We determine how the heat capacity varies as
the model parameters are changed. There are peaks in the heat capacity at state
points where the morphology changes occur. We also map the lattice model onto a
continuum DFT that facilitates a simplification of the stability analysis of
the uniform fluid.

Calculating Soft Radiation at One Loop
Tomas Kasemets Wouter J. Waalewijn Lisa Zeune 
We present an efficient way to calculate the effect of soft QCD radiation at
one loop, which is needed for predictions at next-to-next-to-leading
logarithmic accuracy. We use rapidity coordinates and isolate the divergences
in the integrand. By performing manipulations with cumulative variables, we
avoid complications from plus distributions. We address rapidity divergences,
divergences with an azimuthal dependence, complicated jet boundaries and
multi-differential measurements. The process and measurements can be easily
adjusted, as we demonstrate by reproducing many existing soft functions. The
results for a general LHC process with multiple Wilson lines are obtained by
treating Wilson lines that are not back-to-back using a boost. We also obtain,
for the first time, the N-jettiness soft function for generic jet angularities,
and the collinear-soft function for the measurement of two angularities.

Understanding analog quantum simulation dynamics in coupled ion-trap
  qubits
Yang-Le Wu S. Das Sarma 
We study numerically a disordered transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian with
long-range couplings. This model was recently investigated experimentally in a
trapped-ion quantum simulator and was found to exhibit features of many-body
localization at strong disorder. We use exact diagonalization to study the
collective state preservation and the eigenstate entanglement structure as a
function of both disorder strength and interaction range. Our numerical
results, using the same system sizes as the experiment, verify the observation
of many-body localization reported in the recent quantum simulation experiment.

Precision calculation of 1/4-BPS Wilson loops in AdS$_5\times S^5$
V. Forini V. Giangreco M. Puletti L. Griguolo D. Seminara E. Vescovi 
We study the strong coupling behaviour of $1/4$-BPS circular Wilson loops (a
family of "latitudes") in ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory, computing the
one-loop corrections to the relevant classical string solutions in
AdS$_5\times$S$^5$. Supersymmetric localization provides an exact result that,
in the large 't Hooft coupling limit, should be reproduced by the sigma-model
approach. To avoid ambiguities due to the absolute normalization of the string
partition function, we compare the $ratio$ between the generic latitude and the
maximal 1/2-BPS circle: Any measure-related ambiguity should simply cancel in
this way. We use Gel'fand-Yaglom method to calculate the relevant functional
determinants, that present some complications with respect to the standard
circular case. After a careful numerical evaluation of our final expression we
still find disagreement with the localization answer: The difference is encoded
into a precise "remainder function". We comment on the possible origin and
resolution of this discordance.

q-Virasoro constraints in matrix models
Anton Nedelin Maxim Zabzine 
The Virasoro constraints play the important role in the study of matrix
models and in understanding of the relation between matrix models and CFTs.
Recently the localization calculations in supersymmetric gauge theories
produced new families of matrix models and we have very limited knowledge about
these matrix models. We concentrate on elliptic generalization of hermitian
matrix model which corresponds to calculation of partition function on $S^3
\times S^1$ for vector multiplet. We derive the $q$-Virasoro constraints for
this matrix model. We also observe some interesting algebraic properties of the

On Cheeger and Sobolev differentials in metric measure spaces
Martin Kell 
Recently Gigli developed a Sobolev calculus on non-smooth spaces using module
theory. In this paper it is shown that his theory fits nicely into the theory
of differentiability spaces initiated by Cheeger, Keith and others. A
relaxation procedure for $L^p$-valued subadditive functionals is presented and
a relationship between the module generated by a functional and the one
generated by its relaxation is given. In the framework of differentiability
spaces, which includes so called PI- and $RCD(K,N)$-spaces, the Lipschitz
module is pointwise finite dimensional. A general renorming theorem together
with the characterization above shows that the Sobolev spaces of such spaces
are reflexive.

SNAP: Stateful Network-Wide Abstractions for Packet Processing
Mina Tahmasbi Arashloo Yaron Koral Michael Greenberg Jennifer Rexford David Walker 
Early programming languages for Software-Defined Networking (SDN) were built
on top of the simple match-action paradigm offered by OpenFlow 1.0. However,
emerging switches and middleboxes offer much more sophisticated support for
persistent state in the data plane, without involving a central controller. In
this paper, we introduce high-level programming abstractions and compiler
technology that exploit these low-level mechanisms.
  Our SNAP language allows programmers to mix stateful programming with pure
packet processing using global, persistent arrays indexed by packet-header
fields. This allows SNAP programs to learn about the network environment, store
per-flow information, and implement various stateful network functions. SNAP is
high-level and modular, allowing flexible composition of independently-written
programs on top of a "one-big-switch" abstraction. Our SNAP compiler analyzes
programs to discover dependencies and race conditions, and offers a simple
network transaction abstraction as a way to resolve the latter. A mixed
integer-linear program optimizes both placement of state variables on switches
and also routing traffic through them efficiently and in the right order. To
compile programs efficiently, our compiler uses a novel variant of binary
decision diagrams (BDDs), extended to incorporate stateful components. We have
implemented a prototype compiler, applied it to a range of programs and
topologies, and measured our techniques' scalability.

A unified approach to self-normalized block sampling
Shuyang Bai Murad S. Taqqu Ting Zhang 
The inference procedure for the mean of a stationary time series is usually
quite different under various model assumptions because the partial sum process
behaves differently depending on whether the time series is short or long-range
dependent, or whether it has a light or heavy-tailed marginal distribution. In
the current paper, we develop an asymptotic theory for the self-normalized
block sampling, and prove that the corresponding block sampling method can
provide a unified inference approach for the aforementioned different
situations in the sense that it does not require the {\em a priori} estimation
of auxiliary parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to illustrate
its finite-sample performance. The R function implementing the method is
available from the authors.

improved predictions for proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV. In addition, it is
investigated whether the values of the parameters obtained from fits to UE
observables are consistent with the values determined from fitting observables
sensitive to double-parton scattering processes. Finally, comparisons of the UE

as well as predictions of MB and UE observables at 13 TeV.

Fast algorithm for periodic density fitting for Bloch waves
Jianfeng Lu Lexing Ying 
We propose an efficient algorithm for density fitting of Bloch waves for

selection and random Fourier projection of the orbital functions. The
computational cost of the algorithm scales as $\mathcal{O}\bigl(N_{\text{grid}}
N^2 + N_{\text{grid}} NK \log (NK)\bigr)$, where $N_{\text{grid}}$ is number of
spatial grid points, $K$ is the number of sampling $k$-points in first
Brillouin zone, and $N$ is the number of bands under consideration. We validate
the algorithm by numerical examples in both two and three dimensions.

One-loop Structure of Higher Rank Wilson Loops in AdS/CFT
Alberto Faraggi James T. Liu Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas Guojun Zhang 
The half-supersymmetric Wilson loop in $\mathcal N=4$ SYM is arguably the
central non-local operator in the AdS/CFT correspondence. On the field theory
side, the vacuum expectation values of Wilson loops in arbitrary
representations of $SU(N)$ are captured to all orders in perturbation theory by
a Gaussian matrix model. Of prominent interest are the $k$-symmetric and
$k$-antisymmetric representations, whose gravitational description is given in
terms of D3- and D5-branes, respectively, with fluxes in their world volumes.
At leading order in $N$ and $\lambda$ the agreement in both cases is exact. In
this note we explore the structure of the next-to-leading order correction in
the matrix model and compare with existing string theory calculations. We find
agreement in the functional dependence on $k$ but a mismatch in the numerical
coefficients.

Topology and glueballs in SU(7) Yang-Mills with open boundary conditions
Alessandro Amato Gunnar Bali Biagio Lucini 
It is well known that the topology of gauge configurations generated in a
Markov Monte-Carlo chain freezes as the continuum limit is approached. The
corresponding autocorrelation time increases exponentially with the inverse
lattice spacing, affecting the ergodicity of the simulation. In SU(N) gauge
theories for large N this problem sets in at much coarser lattice spacings than
for N=3. This means that its systematics can be studied on lattices that are
smaller in terms of the number of lattice sites. It has been shown that using
open boundary conditions in time allows instantons to be created and destroyed,
restoring topological mobility and ergodicity. However, with open boundary
conditions translational invariance is lost and the influence of spurious
states propagating from the boundary into the bulk on physical correlators
needs to be carefully evaluated. Moreover, while the total topological charge
can be changed, the mobility of instantons across the lattice is still reduced.
We consider SU(7) Yang-Mills theory and analyse its topological content in the
periodic and open boundary condition cases. We also investigate scalar and
pseudo-scalar glueball correlation functions.

Effects of the sources of reionization on 21-cm redshift-space
  distortions

The observed 21-cm signal from the epoch of reionization will be distorted
along the line-of-sight by the peculiar velocities of matter particles. These
redshift-space distortions will affect the contrast in the signal and will also
make it anisotropic. This anisotropy contains information about the
cross-correlation between the matter density field and the neutral hydrogen
field, and could thus potentially be used to extract information about the
sources of reionization. In this paper, we study a collection of simulated
reionization scenarios assuming different models for the sources of
reionization. We show that the 21-cm anisotropy is best measured by the
quadrupole moment of the power spectrum. We find that, unless the properties of
the reionization sources are extreme in some way, the quadrupole moment evolves
very predictably as a function of global neutral fraction. This predictability
implies that redshift-space distortions are not a very sensitive tool for
distinguishing between reionization sources. However, the quadrupole moment can
be used as a model-independent probe for constraining the reionization history.
We show that such measurements can be done to some extent by first-generation
instruments such as LOFAR, while the SKA should be able to measure the
reionization history using the quadrupole moment of the power spectrum to great
accuracy.

Functional determinants, index theorems, and exact quantum black hole
  entropy
Sameer Murthy Valentin Reys 
The exact quantum entropy of BPS black holes can be evaluated using
localization in supergravity. An important ingredient in this program, that has
been lacking so far, is the one-loop effect arising from the quadratic
fluctuations of the exact deformation (the $Q\mathcal{V}$ operator). We compute
the fluctuation determinant for vector multiplets and hyper multiplets around
$Q$-invariant off-shell configurations in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$
supergravity with $AdS_{2} \times S^{2}$ boundary conditions, using the
Atiyah-Bott fixed-point index theorem and a subsequent zeta function
regularization. Our results extend the large-charge on-shell entropy
computations in the literature to a regime of finite charges. Based on our
results, we present an exact formula for the quantum entropy of BPS black holes
in $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity. We explain cancellations concerning
$\frac18$-BPS black holes in $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity that were observed in
arXiv:1111.1161. We also make comments about the interpretation of a
logarithmic term in the topological string partition function in the low energy
supergravity theory.

Growth control of sessile microbubbles in PDMS devices
Andreas Volk Massimiliano Rossi Christian J. Kähler Sascha Hilgenfeldt Alvaro Marin 
In a microfluidic environment, the presence of bubbles is often detrimental
to the functionality of the device, leading to clogging or cavitation, but
microbubbles can also be an indispensable asset in other applications such as
microstreaming. In either case, it is crucial to understand and control the
growth or shrinkage of these bodies of air, in particular in common
soft-lithography devices based on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is highly
permeable to gases. In this work, we study the gas transport into and out of a
bubble positioned in a microfluidic device, taking into account the direct gas
exchange through PDMS as well as the transport of gas through the liquid in the
device. Hydrostatic pressure regulation allows for the quantitative control of
growth, shrinkage, or the attainment of a stable equilibrium bubble size. We
find that the vapor pressure of the liquid plays an important role for the
balance of gas transport, accounting for variability in experimental conditions
and suggesting additional means of bubble size control in applications.

Regression with Gaussian Radial Basis Functions. We show that modelling

Dipole Codes Attractively Encode Glue Functions
Dhananjay Ipparthi Massimo Mastrangeli Andrew Winslow 
Dipole words are sequences of magnetic dipoles, in which alike elements repel
and opposite elements attract. Magnetic dipoles contrast with more general sets
of bonding types, called glues, in which pairwise bonding strength is specified
by a glue function. We prove that every glue function $g$ has a set of dipole
words, called a dipole code, that attractively encodes $g$: the pairwise
attractions (positive or non-positive bond strength) between the words are
identical to those of $g$. Moreover, we give such word sets of asymptotically
optimal length. Similar results are obtained for a commonly used subclass of
glue functions.

Dust attenuation in z $\sim$ 1 galaxies from Herschel and 3D-HST

We combined the spectroscopic information from the 3D-HST survey with
\textit{Herschel} data to characterize the H$\alpha$ dust attenuation
properties of a sample of 79 main sequence star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 1$
in the GOODS-S field. The sample was selected in the far-IR, at $\lambda$=100
and/or 160 $\mu$m, and only includes galaxies with a secure H$\alpha$ detection
(S/N$>$3). From the low resolution 3D-HST spectra we measured the redshifts and
the H$\alpha$ fluxes for the whole sample (a factor of 1/1.2 was applied to the
observed fluxes to remove the [NII] contamination). The stellar masses
(M$_{\star}$), infrared (L$_{IR}$) and UV luminosities (L$_{UV}$) were derived
from the SEDs by fitting multi-band data from GALEX near-UV to SPIRE 500
$\mu$m. We estimated the continuum extinction E$_{star}$(B-V) from both the
IRX=L$_{IR}$/L$_{UV}$ ratio and the UV-slope, $\beta$, and found an excellent
agreement between the two. The nebular extinction was estimated from comparison
of the observed SFR$_{H\alpha}$ and SFR$_{UV}$. We obtained
\emph{f}=E$_{star}$(B-V)/E$_{neb}$(B-V)=0.93$\pm$0.06, i.e. higher than the
canonical value of \emph{f}=0.44 measured in the local Universe. Our derived
dust correction produces good agreement between the H$\alpha$ and IR+UV SFRs
for galaxies with SFR$\gtrsim$ 20 M$_{\odot}$/yr and M$_{\star} \gtrsim 5
\times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, while objects with lower SFR and M$_{\star}$ seem
to require a smaller \emph{f}-factor (i.e. higher H$\alpha$ extinction
correction). Our results then imply that the nebular extinction for our sample
is comparable to that in the optical-UV continuum and suggest that the
\emph{f}-factor is a function of both M$_{\star}$ and SFR, in agreement with
previous studies.

Among other things, we introduce certain new natural objects `discrete Selmer
groups' and `discrete Shafarevich-Tate groups', and prove that they are
finitely generated $\Bbb Z$-modules. Further, we prove that in the isotrivial
case, the discrete Shafarevich-Tate group vanishes and the discrete Selmer
group coincides with the Mordell-Weil group. One of the key ingredients to
prove these results is a new specialisation theorem \`a la N\'eron for first
Galois cohomology groups, of the ($l$-adic) Tate module of abelian varieties
which generalises N\'eron's specialisation theorem for rational points of
abelian varieties.

Globular Cluster Populations: Results Including S$^4$G Late-Type
  Galaxies
Dennis Zaritsky Kelsey McCabe Manuel Aravena E. Athanassoula Albert Bosma Sébastien Comerón Helene M. Courtois Bruce G. Elmegreen Debra M. Elmegreen Santiago Erroz-Ferrer Dimitri A. Gadotti Joannah L. Hinz Luis C. Ho Benne Holwerda Taehyun Kim Johan H. Knapen Jarkko Laine Eija Laurikainen Juan Carlos Muñoz-Mateos Heikki Salo Kartik Sheth 
Using 3.6 and 4.5$\mu$m images of 73 late-type, edge-on galaxies from the
S$^4$G survey, we compare the richness of the globular cluster populations of
these galaxies to those of early type galaxies that we measured previously. In
general, the galaxies presented here fill in the distribution for galaxies with
lower stellar mass, M$_*$, specifically $\log({\rm M}_*/{\rm M}_\odot) < 10$,
overlap the results for early-type galaxies of similar masses, and, by doing
so, strengthen the case for a dependence of the number of globular clusters per
$10^9\ {\rm M}_\odot$ of galaxy stellar mass, T$_{\rm N}$, on M$_*$. For $8.5 <
\log ({\rm M}_*/{\rm M}_\odot) < 10.5$ we find the relationship can be
satisfactorily described as T$_{\rm N} = ({\rm M}_*/10^{6.7})^{-0.56}$ when
M$_*$ is expressed in solar masses. The functional form of the relationship is
only weakly constrained and extrapolation outside this range is not advised.
Our late-type galaxies, in contrast to our early-types, do not show the
tendency for low mass galaxies to split into two T$_{\rm N}$ families. Using
these results and a galaxy stellar mass function from the literature, we
calculate that in a volume limited, local Universe sample, clusters are most
likely to be found around fairly massive galaxies (M$_* \sim 10^{10.8}$
M$_\odot$) and present a fitting function for the volume number density of
clusters as a function of parent galaxy stellar mass. We find no correlation
between T$_{\rm N}$ and large-scale environment, but do find a tendency for
galaxies of fixed M$_*$ to have larger T$_{\rm N}$ if they have converted a
larger proportion of their baryons into stars.

$2^n-$rational maps
Pavlos Kassotakis Maciej Nieszporski Pantelis Damianou 
We present a natural extension of the notion of nondegenerate rational maps
(quadrirational maps) to arbitrary dimensions. We refer to these maps as
$2^n-$rational maps. In this note we construct a rich family of $2^n-$rational
maps. These maps by construction are involutions and highly symmetric in the
sense that the maps and their companion maps have the same functional form.

Quantum Hall effect, Quillen metric and holomorphic anomaly
Semyon Klevtsov Xiaonan Ma George Marinescu Paul Wiegmann 
We study the generating functional, the adiabatic curvature and the adiabatic
phase for the integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) on a compact Riemann surface.
For the generating functional we derive its asymptotic expansion for the large
flux of the magnetic field, i.e., for the large degree k of the positive
Hermitian line bundle $L^k$. The expansion consists of the anomalous and exact
terms. The anomalous terms are the leading terms of the expansion. This part is
responsible for the quantization of the adiabatic transport coefficients in
QHE. We then identify the anomalous part of the expansion with the Quillen
metric on the determinant line bundle, and the subleading exact part with the
asymptotics of the regularized spectral determinant of the Laplacian for the
line bundle $L^k$, at large k. Finally, we show how the generating functional
of the integer QHE is related to the gauge and gravitational (2+1)d
Chern-Simons functionals. We observe the relation between the
Bismut-Gillet-Soul$\'e$ curvature formula for the Quillen metric and the
adiabatic curvature for the electromagnetic and geometric adiabatic transport
of the integer Quantum Hall state. We then obtain the geometric part of the
adiabatic phase in QHE, given by the Chern-Simons functional.

Analysis of the essential spectrum of singular matrix differential

Orif O. Ibrogimov Petr Siegl Christiane Tretter 
A complete analysis of the essential spectrum of matrix-differential
operators $\mathcal A$ of the form \begin{align} \begin{pmatrix}

q & -\displaystyle{\frac{\rm d}{\rm d t}} b^* \! + c^* \\[2mm] \hspace{6mm} b

\text{in } \ L^2((\alpha, \beta)) \oplus \bigl(L^2((\alpha, \beta))\bigr)^n
\label{mo} \end{align} singular at $\beta\in\mathbb R\cup\{\infty\}$ is given;
the coefficient functions $p$, $q$ are scalar real-valued with $p>0$, $b$, $c$
are vector-valued, and $D$ is Hermitian matrix-valued. The so-called "singular
part of the essential spectrum" $\sigma_{\rm ess}^{\rm \,s}(\mathcal A)$ is
investigated systematically. Our main results include an explicit description
of $\sigma_{\rm ess}^{\rm \,s}(\mathcal A)$, criteria for its absence and
presence; an analysis of its topological structure and of the essential
spectral radius. Our key tools are: the asymptotics of the leading coefficient
$\pi(\cdot,\lambda)=p-b^*(D-\lambda)^{-1}b$ of the first Schur complement of
$\mathcal A$, a scalar differential operator but non-linear in $\lambda$; the
Nevanlinna behaviour in $\lambda$ of certain limits $t\!\nearrow\!\beta$ of
functions formed out of the coefficients in $\mathcal A$. The efficacy of our
results is demonstrated by several applications; in particular, we prove a
conjecture on the essential spectrum of some symmetric stellar equilibrium
models.

Full characterization of a spin liquid phase: from topological entropy
  to robustness and braid statistics
Saeed S. Jahromi Abdollah Langari 
We use the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) as an efficient tool to
fully characterize the Abelian phase of a Z2 * Z2 spin liquid emerging as the
ground state of topological color code (TCC), which is a class of stabilizer
states on the honeycomb lattice. We extract the TEE from Renyi entanglement
entropy (EE) of the TCC, analytically and numerically by finite size exact
diagonalization on the disk shape regions with contractible boundaries. We
obtain that the EE has a local contribution, which scales linearly with the
boundary length in addition to a topological term, i.e. the TEE, arising from
the condensation of closed strings in the ground state. We further show that,
in spite of the lack of a local order parameter, TEE and other physical
quantities obtained from ground state wave function such as entanglement
spectrum (ES) and ground state fidelity are sensitive probes to study the
robustness of a topological phase. We find that the topological order in the
presence of a magnetic field persists until the vicinity of the transition
point, where the TEE and fidelity drops to zero and the ES splits severely,
signaling breakdown of the topological phase of the TCC. Eventually, we
investigate the ground state dependence of the TEE by cutting the torus to half
cylinders, from which we further identify multiple independent minimum entropy
states (MES) of the TCC and then extract the U and S modular matrices of the
system, which contain the self and mutual statistics of the anyonic QPs and
fully characterize the topological phase of the TCC.

Flow of colloidal solids and fluids through constrictions: dynamical
  density functional theory versus simulation
Urs Zimmermann Frank Smallenburg Hartmut Löwen 
Using both dynamical density functional theory and particle-resolved Brownian
dynamics simulations, we explore the flow of two-dimensional colloidal solids
and fluids driven through a linear channel with a geometric constriction. The
flow is generated by a constant external force acting on all colloids. The
initial configuration is equilibrated in the absence of flow and then the
external force is switched on instantaneously. Upon starting the flow, we
observe four different scenarios: a complete blockade, a monotonic decay to a
constant particle flux (typical for a fluid), a damped oscillatory behaviour in
the particle flux, and a long-lived stop-and-go behaviour in the flow (typical
for a solid). The dynamical density functional theory describes all four
situations but predicts infinitely long undamped oscillations in the flow which
are always damped in the simulations. We attribute the mechanisms of the
underlying stop-and-go flow to symmetry conditions on the flowing solid. Our
predictions are verifiable in real-space experiments on magnetic colloidal
monolayers which are driven through structured microchannels and can be
exploited to steer the flow throughput in microfluidics.

Approximate Probabilistic Inference via Word-Level Counting
Supratik Chakraborty Kuldeep S. Meel Rakesh Mistry Moshe Y. Vardi 
Hashing-based model counting has emerged as a promising approach for
large-scale probabilistic inference on graphical models. A key component of
these techniques is the use of xor-based 2-universal hash functions that
operate over Boolean domains. Many counting problems arising in probabilistic
inference are, however, naturally encoded over finite discrete domains.
Techniques based on bit-level (or Boolean) hash functions require these
problems to be propositionalized, making it impossible to leverage the
remarkable progress made in SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theory) solvers that can
reason directly over words (or bit-vectors). In this work, we present the first
approximate model counter that uses word-level hashing functions, and can
directly leverage the power of sophisticated SMT solvers. Empirical evaluation
over an extensive suite of benchmarks demonstrates the promise of the approach.

Numerical studies of the Lagrangian approach for reconstruction of the

Larisa Beilina Kati Niinimäki 
We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the conductivity function
in a hyperbolic equation using single space-time domain noisy observations of
the solution on the backscattering boundary of the computational domain. We
formulate our inverse problem as an optimization problem and use Lagrangian
approach to minimize the corresponding Tikhonov functional. We present a
theorem of a local strong convexity of our functional and derive error
estimates between computed and regularized as well as exact solutions of this
functional, correspondingly. We also show, why gradient method for minimizing
the Tikhonov functional will converge.
  In numerical simulations we apply domain decomposition finite element/finite
difference method for minimization of the Lagrangian. Our computational study
shows efficiency of the proposed method in the reconstruction of the
conductivity function in three dimensions.

Master equation as a radial constraint
Uzair Hussain Ivan Booth Hari K. Kunduri 
We revisit the problem of perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS$_4$ black holes
by using a combination of the Martel-Poisson formalism for perturbations of
four-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetimes and the Kodama-Ishibashi
formalism. We clarify the relationship between both formalisms and express the
Brown-York-Balasubramanian-Krauss boundary stress-energy tensor,
$\bar{T}_{\mu\nu}$, on a finite-$r$ surface purely in terms of the even and odd
master functions. Then, on these surfaces we find that the spacelike components
of the conservation equation $\bar{\mathcal{D}}^\mu \bar{T}_{\mu\nu} =0$ are
equivalent to the wave equations for the master functions. The renormalized
stress-energy tensor at the boundary $\displaystyle \frac{r}{L} \lim_{r
\rightarrow \infty} \bar{T}_{\mu\nu}$ is calculated directly in terms of the
master functions.

Photon self-interaction on deformed spacetime
Raul Horvat Josip Trampetić Jiangyang You 
A novel nonlocal four-photon interaction on the deformed spacetime is derived
and studied in the three selected models (I, II, III). The first two models (I,
II) are obtained via two distinct second-order $\theta$-exact Seiberg-Witten
maps of the noncommutative U(1) gauge field strength on Moyal space. The third
one (III), inspired by the manifestly gauge invariant structures emerging in
the first two, due to the model generality has been constructed with a
different set of freedom parameters. The physical relevancy of all models is
analyzed by evaluating the four-photon-tadpole diagram, which, when combined
with the bubble graph, enables us to fully consider all contributions to the
one-loop photon polarization tensor. For an arbitrary noncommutative matrix
theta^\mu\nu, the full quadratic IR divergence cancellation in the one-loop
photon two-point function is obtained with particular combinations of
Seiberg-Witten map/gauge-symmetry freedom parameters in models I and II.
Finally, our model III enables complete elimination of all pathological terms
in the photon polarization tensor at one-loop order if a special value for the
theta matrix is chosen.

An embedding of loop quantum cosmology in (b, v) variables into a full
  theory context
Norbert Bodendorfer 
Loop quantum cosmology in (b, v) variables, which is governed by a unit step
size difference equation, is embedded into a full theory context based on
similar variables. From the full theory perspective, the symmetry reduction is
characterised by the vanishing of certain phase space functions which are
implemented as operator equations in the quantum theory. The loop quantum
cosmology dynamics arise as the action of the full theory Hamiltonian on
maximally coarse states in the kernel of the reduction constraints. An
application of this reduction procedure to spherical symmetry is also sketched,
with similar results, but only one canonical pair in (b, v) form.

Two-color spectroscopy of UV excited ssDNA complex with a single-wall
  nanotube probe: Fast nucleobase autoionization mechanism
Tetyana Ignatova Alexander Balaeff Ming Zheng Michael Blades Peter Stoeckl Slava V. Rotkin 
DNA autoionization is a fundamental process wherein UV-photoexcited
nucleobases dissipate energy by charge transfer to the environment without
undergoing chemical damage. Here, single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) are
explored as a photoluminescent reporter for studying the mechanism and rates of
DNA autoionization. Two-color photoluminescence spectroscopy allows separate
photoexcitation of the DNA and the SWNTs in the UV and visible range,
respectively. A strong SWNT photoluminescence quenching is observed when the UV
pump is resonant with the DNA absorption, consistent with charge transfer from
the excited states of the DNA to the SWNT. Semiempirical calculations of the
DNA-SWNT electronic structure, combined with a Green's function theory for
charge transfer, show a 20 fs autoionization rate, dominated by the hole
transfer. Rate-equation analysis of the spectroscopy data confirms that the
quenching rate is limited by the thermalization of the free charge carriers
transferred to the nanotube reservoir. The developed approach has a great
potential for monitoring DNA excitation, autoionization, and chemical damage
both {\it in vivo} and {\it in vitro}.

Scanning tunneling microscopy current from localized basis orbital
  density functional theory
Alexander Gustafsson Magnus Paulsson 
We present a method capable of calculating elastic scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) currents from localized atomic orbital density functional
theory (DFT). To overcome the poor accuracy of the localized orbital
description of the wave functions far away from the atoms, we propagate the
wave functions, using the total DFT potential. From the propagated wave
functions, the Bardeen's perturbative approach provides the tunneling current.
To illustrate the method we investigate carbon monoxide adsorbed on a Cu(111)
surface and recover the depression/protrusion observed experimentally with
normal/CO-functionalized STM tips. The theory furthermore allows us to discuss
the significance of s- and p-wave tips.

detection energy threshold of nuclear recoils for a dual-phase xenon detector
can be $\sim$ 6.8 keV for a given number of detectable photoelectrons. We
evaluate the average energy expended per electron-hole pair to be $\sim$8.9 eV,
which sets a detection energy threshold of $\sim$4.5 keV for a germanium
detector at 50 mini-Kelvin at 69 volts with a primary phonon frequency of 2
THz. The Fano factors of nuclear and electronic recoils that constrain the
capability for discriminating nuclear recoils below 2-3 keV recoil energy for
both technologies are different.

Dynamical Features of Open Star Cluster: DOLIDZE 14
Gireesh C. Joshi R. K. Tyagi 
The radial density profile (RDP) of cluster DOLIDZE 14 provides the radius of
9.8 arcmin, it is based on consideration of first plateau region of RDP. This
value is less than the radius which comes through consideration of the second
plateau region. The stars, which are inside of the cluster radius, are used to
estimate the distance-modulus and E(I-R) by fitting theoretical isochrone on
the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). The best fitted stellar isochrone of solar
matellacity provides these values as 11.15 mag and 0.25 mag, respectively.
These results are used to estimate the mass-function slope of the cluster,
which comes to be different that of Salpeter-Value. The enhancement of brighter
stars does not found within the cluster region which indicates its old age. The
Mass-Segregation phenomena of cluster is found between massive and lighter
stars but not found in fainter stars, having magnitude greater than 15 mag in
I-band. The relaxation-time is very little in the comparison of its age. The
mean proper motion of cluster's radial zones is found to be high in the
comparison of field region (12.77-15.18 arcmin). This is indicative of
weak-gravitational bond among the stars of the cluster.

Conversion of second-class constraints and resolving the zero curvature

In the approach to the geometric quantization, based on the conversion of

conditions for the extended symplectic potential. From the zero curvature
conditions, we deduce new, linear, equations for the extended symplectic
potential. Then we show that being the linear equations satisfied, their
solution does certainly satisfy the non-linear zero curvature condition, as
well. Finally, we give the functional resolution to the new linear equations,
and then deduce the respective path integral representation. We do our
consideration as to the general case of a phase superspace where both Boson and
Fermion coordinates are present on equal footing.

The VMC Survey. XVIII. Radial dependence of the low-mass, 0.55--0.82
  $M_\odot$ stellar mass function in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tucanae

We use near-infrared observations obtained as part of the {\sl Visible and
Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy} (VISTA) Survey of the Magellanic
Clouds (VMC), as well as two complementary {\sl Hubble Space Telescope} ({\sl
HST}) data sets, to study the luminosity and mass functions as a function of
clustercentric radius of the main-sequence stars in the Galactic globular
cluster 47 Tucanae. The {\sl HST} observations indicate a relative deficit in
the numbers of faint stars in the central region of the cluster compared with
its periphery, for $18.75\leq m_{\rm F606W}\leq 20.9$ mag (corresponding to a
stellar mass range of $0.55<m_\ast/{M_\odot}<0.73$). The stellar number counts
at $6.7'$ from the cluster core show a deficit for $17.62\leq m_{\rm F606W}\leq
19.7$ mag (i.e., $0.65<m_\ast/{M_\odot}<0.82$), which is consistent with
expectations from mass segregation. The VMC-based stellar mass functions
exhibit power-law shapes for masses in the range $0.55<m_\ast/{M_\odot}< 0.82$.
These power laws are characterized by an almost constant slope, $\alpha$. The
radial distribution of the power-law slopes $\alpha$ thus shows evidence of the
importance of both mass segregation and tidal stripping, for both the first-
and second-generation stars in 47 Tuc.

Reformulation of the strong field approximation for light-matter
  interactions
A. Galstyan O. Chuluunbaatar A. Hamido Yu. V. Popov F. Mota-Furtado P. F. O'Mahony N. Janssens F. Catoire B. Piraux 
We consider the interaction of hydrogen-like atoms with a strong laser field
and show that the strong field approximation and all its variants may be
grouped into a set of families of approximation schemes. This is done by
introducing an ansatz describing the electron wave packet as the sum of the
initial state wave function times a phase factor and a function which is the
perturbative solution in the Coulomb potential of an inhomogeneous
time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. It is the phase factor that
characterizes a given family. In each of these families, the velocity and
length gauge version of the approximation scheme lead to the same results at
each order in the Coulomb potential. By contrast, irrespective of the gauge,
approximation schemes belonging to different families give different results.
Furthermore, this new formulation of the strong field approximations allows us
to gain deeper insight into the validity of the strong field approximation
schemes. In particular, we address two important questions: the role of the
Coulomb potential in the output channel and the convergence of the perturbative
series in the Coulomb potential. In all the physical situations we consider
here, our results are compared to those obtained by solving numerically the
time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation.

Resonant Anderson localization in segmented wires
Cristian Estarellas Llorenç Serra 
We discuss a model of random segmented wire, with linear segments of 2D wires
joined by circular bends. The joining vertices act as scatterers on the
propagating electron waves. The model leads to resonant Anderson localization
when all segments are of similar length. The resonant behavior is present with
one and also with several propagating modes. The probability distributions
evolve from diffusive to localized regimes when increasing the number of
segments in a similar way for long and short localization lengths. As a
function of the energy a finite segmented wire typically evolves from localized
to diffusive to ballistic behavior in each conductance plateau.

The primitivity index function for a free group, and untangling closed
  curves on hyperbolic surfaces. With an appendix by Khalid Bou-Rabee
Neha Gupta Ilya Kapovich 
Motivated by the results of Scott and Patel about "untangling" closed
geodesics in finite covers of hyperbolic surfaces, we introduce and study
primitivity, simplicity and non-filling index functions for finitely generated
free groups. We obtain lower bounds for these functions and relate these free
group results back to the setting of hyperbolic surfaces. An appendix by Khalid
Bou-Rabee connects the primitivity index function to the residual finiteness
growth function for $F_N$.

On concentration for (regularized) empirical risk minimization
Sara van de Geer 
Rates of convergence for empirical risk minimizers have been well studied in
the literature. In this paper we complement the rates by showing that after
normalization, the empirical minimizer concentrates on a single point. Such
results have first been established by \cite{chatterjee2014new} in the least
squares context. We generalize this to other loss functions such minus
log-likelihood for exponential families. We furthermore allow for a strictly
convex regularization penalty. The results are based on concentration
inequalities for maxima of empirical processes.

Optimization approach for the simultaneous reconstruction of the
  dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability functions from limited
  observations
Larisa Beilina Michel Cristofol Kati Niinimäki 
We consider the inverse problem of the simultaneous reconstruction of the
dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability functions of the Maxwell's
system in 3D with limited boundary observations of the electric field. The
theoretical stability for the problem is provided by the Carleman estimates.
For the numerical computations the problem is formulated as an optimization
problem and hybrid finite element/difference method is used to solve the
parameter identification problem.

Temperature-dependent ellipsometry measurements of partial Coulomb
  energy in superconducting cuprates
J. Levallois M. K. Tran D. Pouliot C. N. Presura L. H. Greene J. N. Eckstein J. Uccelli E. Giannini G. D. Gu A. J. Leggett D. van der Marel 
We performed an experimental study of the temperature and doping dependence
of the energy-loss function of the bilayer and trilayer Bi-cuprate family. The
primary aim is to obtain information on the energy stored in the Coulomb
interaction between the conduction electrons, on the temperature dependence
thereof, and on the change of Coulomb interaction when Cooper-pairs are formed.
We performed temperature-dependent ellipsometry measurements on several
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8-x}$ single crystals: under-doped with $T_c=60, 70$
and 83~K, optimally doped with $T_c=91$~K, overdoped with $T_c=81, 70$ and
$58$~K, as well as optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+x}$ with
$T_c=110$~K. Our first observation is that, as the temperature drops through
$T_c$, the loss function in the range up to 2~eV displays an abrupt change of
temperature dependence as compared to the temperature dependence in the normal
state. This effect at -- or close to -- $T_c$ depends strongly on doping, with
a sign-change for weak overdoping. A second observation is that in the
underdoped and optimally doped regime, when cooling down from much higher
temperature, the loss function integral shows a gradual loss of spectral weight
in a temperature range up to twice $T_c$, coinciding with the range where other
experiments have indicated the existence of strongly enhanced
pair-correlations.

Chemical reaction directed oriented attachment: from precursor particles
  to new substances
Yongfei Liu Xiaoying Qin Yong Yang Zhi Zeng Hongxing Xin Zhengfei Dai Chunjun Song Xiaoguang Zhu Di Li Jian Zhang Yoshiyuki Kawazoe 
As a nonclassical crystal growth mode, oriented attachment (OA) plays an
increasingly important role in materials science and nanotechnology, and has
shown great significance in the development of crystal growth theory. The OA
process usually involves the oriented self-assembly of primary nanoparticles
and conversion to single crystals or pseudocrystals by interface fusion (Fig.
1a). It is theorized that the OA process is dominant in the early stage of
crystal growth, driven by the Brownian motion or short-range interactions. Such
oriented alignments usually can be achieved under hydrothermal/solvothermal
conditions, or with the assistance of surfactants (Fig. 1b). In conventional OA
growth, the constituent and phase structure of the formed crystals are
identical to those of the precursor nanocrystals. Here we report a chemical
reaction directed OA growth that can create new substances from the precursor
nanoparticles (Fig. 1c). Specifically, we show that through such a new OA
mechanism, Y2(CO3)3.2H2O nanoparticles can grow into single-crystalline
sandwich-structured NaY(CO3)2.6H2O and (NH4)Y(CO3)2.H2O microsheets by reacting
with NaHCO3 and NH4HCO3, respectively. The assembled architectures are
characterized by layer and spiral growth and other interesting features, such
as kinks, terraces, and steps, indicating that during the OA process the
nanoparticles behave as atoms or molecules do in the classical mode of crystal
growth. Such a chemical reaction directed OA growth can be applied to the
synthesis of other alkali-metal rare-earth double carbonates. Our
first-principles calculations demonstrate that the intercalation reaction plays
a dominant role in the formation of the yttrium double carbonates. Present
findings not only enrich the aggregation-based crystal growth theory, but also
pave a new way for designing advanced functional materials from the elementary
nanoparticles.

Price of Fairness for Allocating a Bounded Resource
Gaia Nicosia Andrea Pacifici Ulrich Pferschy 
In this paper we study the problem of allocating a scarce resource among
several players (or agents). A central decision maker wants to maximize the
total utility of all agents. However, such a solution may be unfair for one or
more agents in the sense that it can be achieved through a very unbalanced
allocation of the resource. On the other hand fair/balanced allocations may be
far from being optimal from a central point of view. So, in this paper we are
interested in assessing the quality of fair solutions, i.e. in measuring the
system efficiency loss under a fair allocation compared to the one that
maximizes the sum of agents utilities. This indicator is usually called the
Price of Fairness and we study it under three different definitions of
fairness, namely maximin, Kalai-Smorodinski and proportional fairness.
  Our results are of two different types. We first formalize a number of
properties holding for any general multi-agent problem without any special
assumption on the agents utility sets. Then we introduce an allocation problem,
where each agent can consume the resource in given discrete quantities (items),
such that the maximization of the total utility is given by a Subset Sum
Problem. For the resulting Fair Subset Sum Problem, in the case of two agents,
we provide upper and lower bounds on the Price of Fairness as functions of an
upper bound on the items size.

Resonant magneto-optic Kerr effect in the magnetic topological insulator
  Cr:(Sb$_x$,Bi$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$
Shreyas Patankar J. P. Hinton Joel Griesmar J. Orenstein J. S. Dodge Xufeng Kou Lei Pan Kang L. Wang A. J. Bestwick E. J. Fox D. Goldhaber-Gordon Jing Wang Shou-Cheng Zhang 
We report measurements of the polar Kerr effect, proportional to the
out-of-plane component of the magnetization, in thin films of the magnetically
doped topological insulator
$(\text{Cr}_{0.12}\text{Bi}_{0.26}\text{Sb}_{0.62})_2\text{Te}_3$. Measurements
of the complex Kerr angle, $\Theta_K$, were performed as a function of photon
energy in the range $0.8\text{ eV}<\hbar\omega<3.0\text{ eV}$. We observed a
peak in the real part of $\Theta_K(\omega)$ and zero crossing in the imaginary
part that we attribute to resonant interaction with a spin-orbit avoided
crossing located $\approx$ 1.6 eV above the Fermi energy. The resonant
enhancement allows measurement of the temperature and magnetic field dependence
of $\Theta_K$ in the ultrathin film limit, $d\geq2$ quintuple layers. We find a
sharp transition to zero remanent magnetization at 6 K for $d<8$~QL, consistent
with theories of the dependence of impurity spin interactions on film thickness
and their location relative to topological insulator surfaces.
